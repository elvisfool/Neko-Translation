China has designs on Europe. Here is how Europe should respond

中国已经开始谋划欧洲

欧洲应如何应对

As Chinese investment pours into the European Union, the Europeans are beginning to worry

当中国投资涌入欧盟时，欧洲人开始感到担忧

EUROPE has caught China’s eye. Chinese investments there have soared, to nearly €36bn ($40bn) in 2016—almost double the previous years’ total. Chinese FDI fell in 2017, but the share spent in Europe rose from a fifth to a quarter. For the most part, this money is welcome. Europe’s trading relationship with China has made both sides richer.

欧洲吸引了中国的注意。2016年中国投资在那里的投资飙升将近360亿欧元（400亿美元）——几乎是前一年总数的两倍。中国在2017年对外直接投资开始下降，但在欧洲的投资份额从五分之一上升到了四分之一。最重要的原因，投资很受欢迎。欧洲与中国的贸易关系使得双方都有所收获。

However, China is also using its financial muscle to buy political influence (see Briefing). The Czech president, Milos Zeman, wants his country to be China’s “unsinkable aircraft-carrier” in Europe. Last year Greece stopped the European Union from criticising China’s human-rights record at a UN forum. Hungary and Greece prevented the EU from backing a court ruling against China’s expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea. Faced with such behaviour, it is only prudent for Europeans to be nervous.

当然，中国也动用了金融力量去获得政治影响。捷克总统，米洛斯·泽曼希望他的国家在欧洲成为中国的“永不沉没的航母”。去年希腊阻止欧盟在联合国中批评中国的人权记录。匈牙利和希腊阻止欧盟反对中国在南中国海扩张领土主张的法院裁决。面对这样的行为，只有谨慎的欧洲人会感到忧虑。

And not only Europeans. The terms on which the emerging undemocratic superpower invests in the outside world are of interest to all countries—particularly if other things, such as foreign policy, may be affected. Americans, increasingly consumed by fears that China poses a commercial and military threat, should be mindful of competition for the loyalties of its oldest ally. For everyone’s sake, it matters that Europeans gauge their welcome to China wisely. Just now, they do not.

不仅仅是欧洲人。这个新兴的非民主超级强国投资在全球的条款是所有国家都感兴趣的——特别是其它一些事情，诸如，也许能影响到外交政策。美国人——越来越被中国制作的商业和军事威胁所产生的恐惧吞噬——应该出于对其旧盟友的忠诚而小心应对竞争者。出于每个人的利益，欧洲人明智地衡量对中国的各种行为是非常重要的。可当下，他们并没有这么做。

A sense of perspective

一种透视感

Many of China’s plans in Europe are just what you would expect of a rising economy. Some investments are private, profit-seeking and harmless. Acquiring technology by buying innovative firms, including in Germany’s Mittelstand, is reasonable, too, so long as deals are scrutinised for national-security risks. There are also things that China, unlike Russia, does not want, such as to undermine the EU or sow chaos by furtively supporting populist, xenophobic parties. It would rather Europe remained stable and open for business. On issues such as climate change and trade, China has acted more responsibly than the Trump administration, seeking to uphold global accords rather than chuck grenades at them.

中国在欧洲的许多计划是大家预期的经济增长。一些是私人、营利以及无害的投资。通过购买创新公司获得技术——包括德国的中小企业——也是合情合理的，只要确认合同对国家安全风险无害。还有一些事情就是中国不像俄罗斯，并不需要破坏欧盟或者偷偷地支持民粹主义和排外的政党从而引发骚乱。其中的议题像天气变化和贸易，中国的行动比特朗普政府更负责，寻求支持全球协议而不是唱反调。

Some Europeans take this to suggest that China is a useful counterweight to an unpredictable Uncle Sam. That is misguided. Europe has far more in common with America than China, however much Europeans may dislike the occupant of the White House. Moreover, China has used the EU’s need for unanimity in many of its decisions to pick off one or two member states in order to block statements or actions of which it disapproves—as with human rights.

一些欧洲人喜欢这些建议，中国是一个有用的砝码去制衡变化莫测的美国政府。欧洲人被误导了。与中国相比，欧洲与美国有更多的共同点，然而太多的欧洲人也许不喜欢美国总统。此外，中国利用欧盟在众多的决定中达成一致的需求，选中一到两个成员国，为了阻止比如像人权这样的声明或者行动获得通过。

Other Europeans seize on such examples to jump tothe opposite conclusion. They fear that Chinese lucre will one day undermine Europe’s military alliance with the United States. Fortunately, that is a long way off, as the French and British navies have shown by joining America and Japan to challenge China in the South China Sea (see article). Until China itself becomes a democracy, of which there is no sign, Europe will surely remain closer to its traditional allies.

其它欧洲人抓住这样的例子，直接得出相反的结论。他们担心 中国的金钱将有一天会破坏欧洲的与美国的军事同盟。很不幸，这是一条漫长的路，当法国和英国的海军已经表明会加入美国和日本共同应对中国在南中国海的行动。直到中国变成一个民主的国家——尽管民主并没有一个标志——欧洲将确定保持与传统盟友更紧密的关系。

Europe thus needs to take a path that avoids the extremes of naivety and hostility. It should avoid mimicking Chinese protectionism. It might sound “fair” to subject Chinese firms in Europe to the restrictions European firms face in China, but it would be a mistake. The permeability of European societies and economies to ideas and influences is a strength.

欧洲由此需要采取避免变成天真和敌意的两个极端。这将避免模仿中国的贸易保护主义。让欧洲的中国公司受制于在中国的欧洲公司听起来也许很公平，但这个想法是错的。对欧洲社会和经济的渗透的想法和影响是强有力的。

But such openness also makes them vulnerable. Hence, governments should vet investments case by case. Montenegro should not have allowed its debts to China to become so perilously vast. Hungary and Poland should have looked harder at certain Chinese infrastructure projects that offer poor value for money or were never properly completed.

但是这种开放性也容易受到伤害。因此，政府应该就具体的投资作具体分析。黑山共和国不应该允许中国成为其债权国而变得危机四伏。匈牙利和波兰应该在中国的基础设施项目中更加谨慎，这些项目花了不值当的钱或者根本没有完成过项目。

Europeans could do more to substantiate their talk of “reciprocity”, or the mantra that the EU and China should treat each other as each wishes to be treated. They could, for example, introduce new instruments to make it clearer who is buying stakes in firms and thus whether they are doing so fairly. They should also increase funding for impartial China research. Transparency should be demanded from political parties, universities, think-tanks and lobbyists. Sometimes Chinese cash buys unsubtle happy talk. More often, it leads to self-censorship and punch-pulling from even prestigious academies.

欧洲人能够做更多事情来验证关于“互惠”的说法，或者欧盟与中国应该像各自希望得到的待遇一样来对待彼此。比如，他们能够引入新的方式——谁购买了公司股份以及是否他们作这一切是否公司平——使之更清晰。他们应该为对中国进行公正的研究增加资金。不同的政党、大学、智囊团以及游客们应该对与中国合作的一切提出透明度的要求。更多时候，这甚至会导致有名望的学院进行自我审查以及对相关行为的抨击。

And Europe should aim to speak as one. None of its states alone can face down China but, acting together, they could do so for decades to come. The EU could, for example, use qualified-majority voting (QMV) rather than unanimous votes on some subjects sensitive to China, such as human rights. This would not work for everything—most EU nations would balk at giving Brussels a veto over how they deploy their military forces. But QMV would make it harder for China to paralyse the EU by picking off one small member at a time. The EU could also co-ordinate investment-screening processes by member states. And it could take better care of those southern and eastern countries particularly vulnerable to China’s influence and provide alternative sources of investment for the projects they deem important. A little more intra-European solidarity would go a long way.

另外，欧洲人应该旨在团结一致。没有其中任何一个国家能独自应对中国。这不会对任何事情起作用——大部分欧盟国家都回避给予布鲁塞尔布置其军事力量的否决权。但是QMV(意：特定多数表决制，译者注)将使中国更难以利用一两个成员国的否决权来麻痹欧盟。欧盟也能通过成员国协调投资审查流程。以及，这能够更好地顾及到南欧与东欧的那些国家，那些国家特别容易受到中国的影响，中国为它们认为是重要的项目提供投资资源。多一点欧洲内部的团结对欧洲大有裨益。

What money can’t buy

有什么是金钱无法购买的


America has a role to play, too. Ideally the Trump administration would stop treating Europeans as free-riders on American power who deserve a good kicking. On trade, especially, the EU is a powerful potential ally in getting China to abide by global norms. America should also work more closely with European governments to set up common standards of transparency, graft-busting and the prevention of influence-peddling—which would make it harder for China to impose its own rules on small countries. At a time when standards for IT and artificial intelligence risk splitting into a Chinese camp and an American one, Europe can help find a middle path.

美国也有自己的角色要饰演。理想的情况是，特朗普政府不会再认为欧洲人搭上了美国权力的顺风车，而他们理应受到严厉的惩罚。特别在贸易上，欧盟是强有力的潜在同盟让中国遵守全球规则。美国也应该与欧洲政府更密切地合作，以建立一个透明的、打击贪腐以及预防以权谋私的共同标准，这一切都使中国难以用其自身的规则去影响一些小国家。每次当信息技术和人工智能的标准面临分裂为中国阵营以及美国阵营的风险时，欧洲总能平衡其中。



As China rises, the benefits for the world of an independent, open and free Europe will only increase. Conversely, a Europe weakened and divided by the world’s most powerful authoritarian regime would exacerbate problems far beyond the EU’s borders. Europe must not let that happen.

随着中国崛起，一个独立、开放并且自由的欧洲对世界的好处只会多，不会少。相反地，一个世界上最强大的独裁政权削弱以及分裂欧洲将会恶化这些问题，而这些问题将会超出欧盟的边境。欧洲不允许这一切的发生。
