Move needed to ‘avoid being declared bankrupt’: prime minister

需要采取行为“避免破产”：总理表示

Signals return to rocky ties with neighboring Singapore

与领国新加坡的关系摇摇欲坠

Malaysia’s Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said he will cancel a proposed multibillion-dollar high-speed railway link to Singapore, scrapping a signature project of his predecessor Najib Razak in what he called a move to cut costs.

马来西亚总理马哈蒂尔表示，将取消数十亿美元的马新高铁项目，废除其前任纳吉签署的，被称之为降低成本的项目。

Mahathir, who returned to power in a surprise election win this month, said Monday that ending the project will take time as it requires negotiation with Singapore. The city-state’s transport ministry said later Monday that it hadn’t received any official notification from Malaysia, adding that both sides had agreed to proceed with the high-speed rail link “based on mutual benefits.”

马哈蒂尔，在本月的选举中意外地重返政坛，他在周一时表示，与新加坡谈判结束该项目需要时间。新加坡运输部回应，在上周一还没收到马来西亚的官方通知，接着补充说，双方同意在"互惠互利"的情况下继续进行高铁项目。

The decision would deal a setback to construction and rail companies in Asia, including those from China and Japan that are keen to gain a slice of orders. The 350-kilometer (220-mile) line, with trains moving at a top speed of more than 300 kilometers an hour, was targeted to begin operating in 2026. It would’ve trimmed the land journey between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore to 90 minutes, from about five hours now.

这个决定将会打击在亚洲的建筑和铁路公司，包括那些渴望在此项目分一杯羹的中国和日本公司。350公里（220英里）的海岸线，列车最高时速超过300公里，计划2026年通车。将会使从吉隆坡到新加坡的车程从现在的5个小时缩至90分钟。

“It’s going to cost us a huge sum of money -- we’ll make no money at all from this operation,” Mahathir told reporters in Kuala Lumpur. “It’s only a short track. It is going to save you only one hour by taking the HSR.”

“这得花我们好多钱——我们从这个项目里得不到什么收益，”马哈蒂尔告诉吉隆坡的记者。“这仅仅是缩短了距离，如果乘坐HSR只能省一个小时。”

The move also signals a return to rocky ties between Malaysia and Singapore that characterized Mahathir’s first stint in power from 1981 to 2003. Relations had improved under Najib, who in 2013 had agreed with his Singaporean counterpart Lee Hsien Loong to build the rail link.

这一举动也标志着马来西亚和新加坡的关系难以维持，这也马哈蒂尔自1981年至2003年以来首次执政的特点。在纳吉的领导下，两国关系得到改善，他在2013年与新加坡内阁资政李光耀达成协议修建这条铁路。希望与新加坡修建“曲桥”的领导人，回归了。

“I think the people of Singapore, like the people in Malaysia, must be tired of having the same government, the same party since independence,” Mahathir told the Financial Times.


“我认为新加坡人民，就像马来西人民一样，一定厌倦了自独立以来相同的政府与政党，”马哈蒂尔告诉《金融时报》记者。

In that interview, Mahathir said the decision to scrap the rail link was to “avoid being declared bankrupt.” Construction would have cost Malaysia 110 billion ringgit ($28 billion), Mahathir told FT.

在访谈中，马哈蒂尔表示放弃这条铁路的修建是为了“避免国家破产。”这个项目将消耗马来西亚1100亿令吉（280亿美元），他告诉《金融时报》记者。

The project has attracted interest from many companies in Asia and Europe. While Korea Rail Network Authority and a group of South Korean companies won the reference design consultant contract, Chinese firms led by China Railway Signal & Communication Corp. and CRRC Corp., Siemens AG, Alstom SA and some Japanese conglomerates are among those in the race for the project.

该项目吸引了不少来自于亚洲和欧洲的公司。韩国铁道网管理局和南韩的公司赢得了参考设计顾问合同，以中国铁路信号通讯有限公司为首的一些中国公司，CRRC集团，西门子公司，法国阿尔斯通以及一些日本集团企业都参与了这个项目的竞标。

The prime minister also said Malaysia would talk to the Chinese government about renegotiating what he called “unequal treaties,” including a Chinese company-led $14 billion East Coast rail project in peninsular Malaysia, according to the FT.

据《金融时报》报道，首相也表示，马来西亚会和中国政府重新开展他称之为“不公平条约”的谈判，包括以中国公司为首承建的140亿美元在马来西亚半岛的东海岸铁路项目。


Mahathir’s government is faced with liabilities that exceed 1 trillion ringgit due to state guarantees on borrowing by 1MDB, an investment company that’s at the center of a multibillion-dollar corruption scandal. That’s nearly double the 687 billion ringgit federal government debt number disclosed by the former administration.

由国家对1MDB借款的担保——这家投资公司正处在数十亿美元的腐败丑闻中——马哈蒂尔的政府面临着超过1万亿令吉的债务。这几乎前政府公布的6780亿令吉的联邦债务数目的两倍。

Malaysian police last week seized about $29 million in cash, hundreds of handbags, as well as jewelry and watches in raids on premises linked to Najib and the investigation into 1MDB. Najib has denied wrongdoing in the 1MDB case and taken to social media to defend his economic record, saying his government complied with public debt reporting guidelines as defined by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.

马来西亚警察上周检获2900万现金，数以过百的手袋，以及珠宝和手表突袭与纳吉有关的场所以及对1MDB的调查。纳吉否认在1MDB中的不当行为以及在社交媒体上为他的记录辩护，表示他的政府遵守由国家货币基金组织和世界银行制定的公共债务报告准则。

Malaysia has also decided to end the search for the missing MH370 jet by U.S. exploration company Ocean Infinity. The firm had won many extensions after the original three-month contract signed in January. No further time will be granted after May 29, Transport Minister Anthony Loke Siew Fook told reporters separately on Monday.

马来西亚也决定终止美国海洋无限勘探公司对马航MH370的搜索。这家公司在一月份签署了最初的三个月合约，之后又得到了延期。交通部长陆兆福在周一分别对记者说，5月29日后将不再延期。
