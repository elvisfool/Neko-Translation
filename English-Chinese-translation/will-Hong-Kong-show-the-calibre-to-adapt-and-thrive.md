No longer China’s super connector, will Hong Kong show the calibre to adapt and thrive?

不再是中国的桥头堡，香港还会有适应和发展的能力吗？

REGINA IP 葉劉淑儀·2017年6月4日

In the post-war years, Hong Kong has benefited from the restoration of peace, but it has also had its fair share of social and economic upheavals.

战后的几年，香港在和平重建中受益，但是它也有社会成果公平分配和经济动荡时期。

Exogenous and domestic shocks – the Korean war-induced trade embargo in the early 1950s, the spillover of China’s Cultural Revolution in the 1960s, the oil price shocks of the 1970s, the collapse of confidence in the city’s future in the early 1980s, the avian flu, the Asian financial crisis and the resultant severe downturn, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, the mass protest against the enactment of national security legislation in 2003, the global financial tsunami of 2008 and, more recently, the prolonged disruption of public order during Occupy Central – all at one point or another threatened to doom the city.

外界和本土的冲击——朝鲜战争——在50年代造成贸易禁运，60年代中国文化大革命的影响，70年代石油价格冲击，80年代初，对城市未来信心的丧失，禽流感，亚洲金融危机造成的严重经济衰退，严重的急性呼吸道系统综合症的爆发，2003年对国家安全立法的大规模抗议，2008年全球金融风暴以及最近，在占中期间长期扰乱的公众秩序——在不同年代至少有一次机会能摧毁这座城市。

On many such occasions, Hong Kong’s leaders said to the world: “Don’t write off Hong Kong. Hong Kong will bounce back!” And it certainly did.

在许多这样的场合，香港领导者告诉世界：“别放弃香港，香港一定会挺过来的！“它确实这样做了。

After every crisis, the property market and the Hang Seng Index never failed to bounce back. Now both are at or near historic highs. Yet, there has never been more anger and disillusionment among young people. It has never been harder for the administration to forge a consensus on any issue or to move forward on any developmental projects.

每次危机过后，地产市场和恒生指数从未出现过反弹。现在两者都处于或者接近历史最高值。是的，年轻人的愤怒和幻灭感从未如此之多。对政府来讲，在任何问题上达成共识和推动发展项目上遇到前所未有的困难。

Above all, it has never been harder for the administration to bring good people into the government. What has gone wrong?

尤其是，从未试过把优秀人材引入政府部门变得这么的困难。问题出在哪儿？

One cannot simply blame this sorry state of affairs on the lack of universal suffrage, or the alleged encroachment on Hong Kong’s “high level of autonomy” by the central authorities.

但是人们不能单纯地把这种可悲的状况归咎为没有普选权，或者说，被中央政府侵蚀了香港的“高度自治权”。

After all, democratic development here is a relatively recent phenomenon. Before 1997, the colonial masters had always called the shots. So why such anguish over Hong Kong’s inability to control its destiny? Perhaps it is because expectations have been too high over “Kong Kong people ruling Hong Kong”; too much hype about Hong Kong being the “dragon head” of the Pearl River Delta or China’s “super-connector”.
毕竟，香港的民主发展也是近来才出现的现象。在1997前，殖民国总是发号施令。但为何香港总是处于不能掌握自己命运的痛苦之中？也许是因为对“港人治港”抱有太大的期许；也许对香港成为珠江三角洲“的“龙头”或中国”桥头堡作用大肆的宣传。

Twenty years after the reunification, the reality is gradually sinking in that perhaps Hong Kong people are incapable of ruling Hong Kong, and it is not the regional leader that it purported to be.

回归后二十年，情况逐渐让人觉得沮丧，也许港人不能自治，以及不能成为他们认为的地区管理者。

The city has nurtured many world-class business leaders and professionals. Yet, as scholar Dr Derek Yuen Mi-cheung pointed out, before 1997 the local government had done well as an “administrative state”, faithfully doing its masters’ bidding.

这座城市培养了许多世界级的商业领袖和专业人士。然而，正如博士袁敏祥指出的那样，在1997前港英政府作为一个“行政型国家”运作得非常好，忠实地执行殖民国的指令。
Post-1997, the local administration has soldiered on as a “managerial state”, providing continuity and certainty in managing the day-to-day affairs of the city. Yet, it has never successfully morphed into a “political state”, producing political leaders who show real leadership and can restore confidence.

1997年以后，本地政府作为“管理型国家”，继续管理着城市的日常事务。然而，并没有成功地转变为“政治型国家”，产生展现真正的领导力和重塑信心的政治领袖。

The difficulty being experienced by the chief executive-elect in bringing good people into the government is a case in point. Potential candidates either find the kitchen too hot, the salaries too low, or their skin not thick enough for political assaults. Missing in action are leaders with a passionate commitment to Hong Kong who are prepared to stick with the city through thick and thin.

特首把优秀人材引入政府所遇到的困难就是一个很好的例子。候选人发现要么机构内部关系太复杂，薪酬太低，要么就是脸皮不够厚抵挡不住政治攻击。对香港豪言壮志的官员们缺乏行动力，他们曾经用不同的方式来治理香港。

Nor is there much point in hyping Hong Kong as the “dragon head” of the Pearl River Delta or the nation’s “super-connector”. The latter epithet increasingly rings hollow, as more and more Chinese cities are hooking up with cities in the West as “sister cities”. Many a Chinese mayor has been to the Silicon Valley or Israel in pursuit of the holy grail of innovation, without the help of Hong Kong.

把香港宣传为珠三角的”龙头“或国家的”桥头堡“也没什么意义。后者的名称更显空洞，越来越多的中国城市与西方城市结为”友好城市“。 很多中国的市长没有香港的帮助去到硅谷或者以色列取经创新行业。

What the city needs to do is wake up to the new realities – you no longer monopolise the China trade; you have lost your intermediary functions in many ways; your position as a regional aviation, trading, transport and shipping hub is under threat.

一座城市需要做的就是清醒地认识到现实——不能再垄断中国的贸易；失去了在很多行业里的中介功能；作为支线航空，贸易，运输和航运中心的位置已经做受到威胁。

You account for only roughly 2 per cent of China’s gross domestic product, compared to a quarter at the zenith of Hong Kong’s prosperity. As an “inalienable part” of China as opposed to being a “dependent territory” of Britain, you are much more of an integral part of a large and highly centralised, unitary state than you had ever been in relation to Britain. There has been a fundamental paradigm shift and Hongkongers need to learn to play by the new rules of the game.

香港的财政收入粗略计算只有中国GDP的2%, 和最繁荣的顶峰时期相比也只得四分之一。作为中国”不可分割“的一部分而不是英国的”独立领土“，香港更像中央高度集权整体的一部分。这是一种彻底的转变，香港人需要学习新的游戏规则。

This is not to suggest that the world or the rest of the nation should write off Hong Kong. Hong Kong still possesses many unique advantages. It is the most international city in China, with a freely convertible currency and free movement of people, goods, capital and information. Its position as the sole international financial centre in China remains unrivalled. Its geography has not changed – it is strategically located on the South China coast, enjoying an advantageous position along China’s new, 21st century maritime silk road.

这不是说世界或国家应该放弃香港。香港依然拥有许多独特的优势。是中国最国际化的城市，自由兑换货币，自由迁移的人，货物，资本和信息。其作为中国唯一的国际金融中心的位置依然无可匹敌。它的地理位置没有改变——处于南中国海的战略位置，在中国的21世纪和海上丝绸之路上享有得天独厚的优势。

It also has considerable soft power – its prevalent dialect, Cantonese, connects it to Guangdong, Guangxi, and many Cantonese-speaking Chinese communities around the world. Above all, it is probably one of the few communities in the world which is steeped in Western values but also understands the Chinese mind.

香港也有相当大的软实力——它的流行语，广东话，将广东、广西和许多在全球讲广东话的中国社区联接在一起。最重要的是，它是世界上少有的能被西方价值熏陶而又同时理解中国文化的社区之一。

The greatest question remains the calibre of its people. Does the city have enough people with true grit and talent who can thrive in the new order? The next five years are critical, as Hong Kong people wait to see if the new leadership will make a difference.

最大的问题依然是人的才智。这座城市有多少拥有勇气和智慧的人，能在新秩序中茁壮成长吗？未来的五年是严峻的，正如香港人期待着新的领导能否有所作为。
