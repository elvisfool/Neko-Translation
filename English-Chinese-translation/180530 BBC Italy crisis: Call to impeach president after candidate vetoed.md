Italy is mired in fresh political turmoil, with the president facing impeachment calls after he vetoed a choice for finance minister.
 
意大利深陷新一轮政治骚乱，总统在否决财政部长作为候选人后，面临弹劾。
 
In a rare move, President Sergio Mattarella said he could not appoint the Eurosceptic Paolo Savona, citing concerns by investors.

总统Sergio Mattarella罕有的表示，不会任命疑欧派Paolo Savona，理由是投资者对前景表示忧虑。
 
The decision ended a bid by Italy's two populist parties to form a coalition.

Mr Mattarella may now appoint a stop-gap prime minster with early elections looking increasingly likely.

 Mattarella可能会在提前大选前任命一名临时总理。

He has summoned Carlo Cottarelli, a former executive director of the International Monetary Fund, who could form an interim administration.

他召集国际货币基金组织前执行总裁Carlo Cottarelli，以组建临时政府。

Italy, the eurozone's fourth-biggest economy, has been without a government since elections in March because no political group can form a majority.

意大利作为欧元区第四大经济体，自三月选举以来没有任何政治团体能组成多数派政府，处于真空状态。

The Five Star Party had been trying to form a government with another populist party, the right-wing League.

五星运动党试图与其它民粹主义政党——右翼联盟——组建政府。

The BBC's James Reynolds in Rome says a temporary prime minister is unlikely to last long and early elections may have to be called.

BBC在罗马的记者James Reynolds报道，临时总理坐镇时间不会太长，因为即将开始提前大选。

There is now a real argument between the president and the populists about Italy's position in the EU, he adds.

他补充，总统和民粹主义之间就意大利在欧盟的位置展开争论。

What caused the crisis?

引发危机的原因

A political novice, Giuseppe Conte, was proposed by the two populist parties as prime minister in an attempt to break Italy's 11-week political deadlock.

Giuseppe Conte作为政治新手被两个民粹主义政党提名为总理候选人，试图打破意大利长达11周的政治僵局。

He went to meet Mr Mattarella to put forward choices for his cabinet but the president vetoed Mr Savona as finance minister, citing his fierce opposition to membership of the eurozone.

他前去会见Mattarella，为其组建内阁提出选择方案，但是他否决Savona出任财政部长，因其支持脱欧。

Justifying his move, he said "uncertainty about our position in the euro has alarmed Italian and foreign investors", and argued that Mr Savona's stance clashed with the two parties' own position on Europe.

为了证明他的看法，他表示，"由于我们在欧元立场上的不确定性，已经为意大利和投资者敲响警钟"，并认为，Savona的立场与两个政党就欧洲观点问题发生冲突。

"I asked for... an authoritative person from the parliamentary majority who is consistent with the government programme... who isn't seen as a supporter of a line that could probably, or even inevitably, provoke Italy's exit from the euro," Mr Mattarella said.

"我请求。。。与政府的目标相一致的议会多数派里的一位权威人士的协助，有谁被视为不可能，避免让意大利退出欧元区的人。"Mattarella表示。

He added that Mr Conte had refused to support "any other solution" and then surrendered his mandate to be PM.

他补充，Conte拒绝支持"其它解决方案"并放弃了总理的职务。

How unusual is this?
有多不寻常？

Under Italian law, the president has the right to reject the appointment of a cabinet member but the power is rarely used.

根据意大利法律，总统有权拒绝任命内阁成员，但该权力很少使用。

According to the AFP news agency, it has happened at least three times before, including in 1994 when then-President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro blocked attempts by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to appoint his personal lawyer Cesare Previti as Minister of Justice.

根据法新社的报道，这种情况发生过三次，包括1994年，时任总统Oscar Luigi Scalfaro阻止前总理Silvio Berlusconi任命他的私人律师Cesare Previti出任司法部长。

The president's role is largely ceremonial but he does have some key powers, such as appointing heads of government and the ability to dissolve parliament.

总统的角色主要是一种形式，但是他也有一些关键的权力，比如，任命政府首脑以及解散议会。

With Italy seeing frequent instability - there have been dozens of governments since 1946 - the president has often stepped in during a crisis.

随着意大利政局的频繁波动——自1946年以来组建的众多政府——总统在危机出现时经常介入解决。

What was the reaction?

反应如何？

Five Star's leader Luigi Di Maio called for impeachment under article 90 of the constitution, which allows parliament to demand a president step down based on a simple majority vote.

五星运动党Luigi Di Maio呼吁用宪法第90条弹劾总统，该条款允许议会要求总统以简单多数票的方式下台。

If the vote is in favour, the country's constitutional court then decides whether to impeach or not.

假如赞成投票，国家的宪法法庭将决定是否弹劾。

"I want this institutional crisis to be taken to parliament... and the president tried," Mr Di Maio said.

我希望议会能解决该制度危机。。。总统应该去尝试，"Di Maio回答。

"Why don't we just say that in this country it's pointless that we vote, as the ratings agencies, financial lobbies decide the governments?" he asked in a video on Facebook.

"我们为什么不能说这个国家投票是没有意义的，由于评级机构，金融游说影响了政府"，他在脸书视频采访时问道。

League leader Matteo Salvini called for fresh elections.

联盟领袖Matteo Salvini呼吁重新选举。

"In a democracy, if we are still in democracy, there's only one thing to do, let the Italians have their say," he told supporters in a speech in central Italy.

"在民主国家，假如我们国家还是的话，那只有一件事可做，让意大利人自己做选择，"在意大利中部一场演讲中他告诉其支持者。

What happens now?

现在情况如何？

Mr Mattarella said he would wait before deciding whether to call fresh elections, and summoned Mr Cottarelli for talks on Monday.

Mattarella表示，他将决定是否举行重新选举之前等待，并且他召集Cottarelli在周一进行会谈。

Mr Cottarelli, 64, worked at the IMF from 2008 to 2013, gaining the nickname "Mr Scissors" for making cuts to public spending in Italy.

Cottarelli现年64岁，曾在2008年至2013年期间任职于国家货币基金组织，由于在意大利削减公共开支而获得"剪刀先生"的外号。

President Mattarella warned on Sunday that the prospect of a populist government had worsened the "spread" - the gap between Italian and German 10-year government bond yields, seen as a key measure of risk.

总统Mattarella在周日警告，民粹主义政府的执政前景会恶化两国债券的"利差"——意大利和德国10年国债收益率之间的差距，被视为衡量风险的关键。

The spread rose to 215 basis points on Friday - the widest in four years. Ratings agency Moody's warned that it might downgrade Italy's sovereign debt rating to "Baa3" - one notch above the junk rating.

在周五，意大利CDS上涨215个基点——为四年来最大水平。评级机构穆迪警告，可能下调意大利的主权债务评级到"Baa3"——比垃圾评级高一级。

Mr Savona, who served as industry minister during the 1990s, has been an outspoken critic of the EU and an opponent of austerity programmes.

Savona曾在上世纪90年代担任工业部长，对欧盟的批评直言不讳以及反对紧缩计划。

That has prompted concern over the proposed coalition's commitment to the EU and its ability to rein in the country's massive national debt - equal to 1.3 times its annual output.

这引起了人们关于提议对欧盟的联盟承诺和解决大量国家债务的担忧——这些债务相当于年产出的1.3倍。
