The missing middle class
消失的中产
There is a hole where India’s middle class should be. 在那儿有一个应该是中产的位置

That should worry the government and companies那是政府和公司应该担忧的事情  

AFTER China, where next?在中国之后，谁会接中国的班？

Over the past two decades, the world’s most populous country has become the market qua non of just about every global company seeking growth. As its economy slows, businesses are looking for the next set of consumers to keep the tills ringing.

在过去二十年中，世界上人口最多的国家已经成为全球每一个希望业务增长的公司的必要市场。随着经济的疲弱，商人们正在寻找下一个能够保持增长的消费市场。

To many, India feels like the heir apparent. Its population will soon overtake its Asian rival’s. It occasionally grows at the kind of pace that propelled China to the status of economic superpower. And its middle class is thought by many to be in the early stages of the journey to prosperity that created hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers.
。Exuberant management consultants speak of a 300m-400m horde of potential frapuccino-sippers, Fiesta-drivers and globe-trotters. Rare is the chief executive who, upon visiting India, does not proclaim it as central to his or her plans. Some of that maybe a diplomatic dose of flattery; much of it, from firms such as IKEA, SoftBank, Amazon and Starbucks, is sincerely meant. 

对于许多公司来说，印度似乎是下一个显而易见的市场。其人口将会超过亚洲其它国家。它偶而会像推动中国那样的经济大国的步伐来增长。很多人认为其中产会步入繁荣的早期阶段，这一阶段创造了亿万的中国消费者。信心满满的管理咨询公司正谈及3-4亿潜在的星冰乐消费人群，嘉年华的组织者和环球旅行者。大部分的CEO在访问印度时会宣布这会是他或她计划重点。其中一些不乏是外交上的恭维，但是大部分如宜家，软银，亚马逊以及星巴克都表现出了合作的真诚态度。

Hold your elephants. 抓重点

The Indian middle class conjured up by the marketers and consultants scarcely exists. Firms peddling anything much beyond soap, matches and phone-credit are targeting a minuscule slice of the population (see page 16). The top 1% of Indian adults, a rich enclave of 8m inhabitants making at least$20,000 a year, equates to roughly HongKong in terms of population and average income. The next 9% is akin to central Europe, in the middle of the global wealth pack. The next 40% of India’s population neatly mirrors its combined South Asian poor neighbours, Bangladesh and Pakistan. The remaining half-billion or so are on a par with the most destitute bits of Africa. To be sure, global companies take the markets of central Europe seriously. Plenty of fortunes have been made there. But they are no China. 

印度中产对于市场营销人员和咨询顾问来说近乎忽略。除了肥皂，火柴和手机信贷外，各种公司都把市场对准了极少数的人群（见16页）。1%的印度顶尖收入者，一个有着800万人口的富人区，每年至少赚2万美元，就人口和收入而言，大致相当于香港。接下来的9%相当于中欧，全球财富榜的中间位置。接下来的印度人口的40%是南亚贫穷的领国孟加拉和巴基斯坦的缩影。剩下的五亿人口相当于极度落后的非洲地区。诚然，全球的公司对于中欧的市场是非常认真的。大部分的财富从那里诞生。但并不是中国。

Centre parting分水岭

Worse, the chances of India developing a middle class to match the Middle Kingdom’s are being throttled by growing inequality. The top 1% of earners pocketed nearly a third of all the extra income generated by economic growth between 1980 and 2014, according to new research from economists including Thomas Piketty. The well-off are ten times richer now than in 1980; those at the median have not even doubled their income. India has done a good job at getting those earning below $2 a day (at purchasing-power parity) to $3, but it has not matched other countries’ records in getting those on $3 a day to earning $5, those at $5 a day to $10, and so on. Middle earners in countries at India’s stage of development usually take more of the gains from growth. Eight in ten Indians cite inequality as a big problem, on a par with corruption.

更糟糕的是，发展中的印度中产的机会由于与中央政府的抗衡被日益增长的不公平而扼杀。根据托马斯·皮凯特等经济学家的最新研究，在1980年至2014年间，最高收入1%的人群，由经济增长带来的将近三分之一的额外收入括入囊中。现在这些有钱人比80年代时富有十倍；中位数人群的收入还没有翻倍。印度在每天的收入低于2美元到3美元的工作上做得很不错（在购买力平价方面），但这并不能与那些每天能挣3美元到5美元一天，或者5美元到10美元一天的的国家相比，或者诸如此类的比较。在发展中的印度，这个国家的中产通常能从经济增长中获益不少。80%的印度人认为与腐败一样，不公平是个大问题。

The reasons for this failure are not mysterious. Decades of statist intervention meant that when a measure of liberalisation came in the early1990s, only a few were able to benefit. The workforce is woefully unproductive—no surprise given the abysmal state of India’s education system, which churns out millions of adults equipped only formenial work. Its graduates go on to toil in small or micro-enterprises, operating informally; these “employ” 93% of all Indians. The greats well of middle-class jobs that China created as it became the workshop to the world is not to be found in India, because turning small businesses into productive large ones is made nigh-on impossible by bureaucracy. The fact that barely a quarter of women work—a share that has seen a precipitous decline in the past decade—only makes matters worse.

造成这种失败的原因不难理解。过去几十年中央集权的干预意味着在90年代初市场自由化出现时，仅有少数人能获利。劳动力是不值钱的——印度糟糕的教育系统不足为奇，这个系统培养了数以百万仅仅能从事模板式工作的人群。这些毕业生到微小型企业继续辛苦，加班加点地工作，这些企业“雇用”了93%的印度人。在中国制造的由车间到世界工厂的大量中产的就业岗位在印度并没有发生，因为由官僚主义把一家小公司变成一家大规模生产能力的企业是不可能的。事实上，只有四分之一的女性在工作——这一比例急剧下降——让情况变得更糟糕。

Good policy can do an enormous amount to improve prospects. However, hope should be tempered by realism. India is blessed with a deeply entrenched democratic system, but that is no shield against poor decisions. The sudden and brutal “demonetisation” of the economy in 2016 was meant to target fat cats, but ended up hurting everybody. And the path to prosperity walked by China, where manufacturing produced the jobs.That pushed up incomes, is narrowing as automation limits opportunities for factory work.

好的政策能为发展前景作出巨大的改变。然而，希望应该由现实来中和。印度拥有其根深蒂固的民主制度，但是并不能有效解决问题。2016年突如其来和粗暴的“废钞”举措目的在于针对富人，但最后却伤及所有人。当在工厂工作的工人被自动化代替时，中国制造的繁荣之路——在那里工厂制造了工作岗位以及收入——正在缩小。

All of which means that companies need to deal with the India that exists today rather than the one they wish to emerge. As trategy of waiting for Indians to develop a taste for products that the global middle class indulges in—cars as income per head crosses one threshold, foreign holidays when it crosses the next—may lead to decades of frustration. Only 3% of Indian shave ever been on an aero plane; only one in 45 owns a car or lorry. If nearly 300m Indians count as “middle class”, as HSBC has proclaimed, some of them make around $3 a day.

这意味着这些公司需要和现实中的印度——而不是他们想象中的印度——做生意。未来印度人的策略是生产一些能使全球中产沉溺于其的产品——当收入迈入某一门槛的汽车，当收入再提高到某一程度时的外国假期——或许会导致数十年的经济低迷。只有3%的印度人坐过飞机；仅1/45的人拥有汽车或卡车。正如汇丰银行所称，假如近3亿印度被定义为“中产“的话，他们每天只挣3美金。

Big market, smaller opportunities大市场，小机会

Companies would do better to “Indianise” their business by, for example, peddling wares using regional languages preferred by hundreds of millions of Indians. Pricing matters. Services proffered at the same price in India as Indiana will appeal to mere millions, not a billion. Even for someone in the
top 10% of Indian earners, an annual Netflix subscription can cost over a week’s income; the equivalent in America would be around $3,000. Apple ads may plaster Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore, but for only one in ten Indians would the latest iPhone represent less than half a year’s salary. The biggest consumer hits in India have been goods and services that offer
stonking value: scooters and mobile telephony have grown fast, but only after prices tumbled.

这些公司将其业务和定价“印度本土化“，比如，数亿的印度人用本土语言来销售产品。在印度以同样的价格提供服务只能吸引到数百万人，而不是数十亿。尽管在收入最高的10%的人群中，网飞一年的订阅费用可能超过其他人一周的收入；在美国约为3000美元。苹果公司的广告会覆盖孟买，德里和班加罗尔，但只有十分之一的印度人用不到半年的薪水来购买最新的IPhone.印度最大的的消费群体是提供了巨大价值的商品和服务：摩托车和移动电话发展迅猛，但只是在价格大跌之后。



The sharpest businesses work out which “enablers” will allow Indians to gain access to new goods. Electrification drives demand for fridges. Cheap mobile data (India is in the midst of a data-price war that has hugely benefited consumers) are a boon to streaming services. Logistics networks put together by e-commerce giants are for the first time making it possible for a consumer in a third-tier city to buy global fashion brands. A surge in consumer financing has put desirable baubles within reach of more Indians.

最精明的商人都知道把印度人得到好东西的“办法“。电气化推动冰箱的需求。廉价的移动数据（印度正处于一场数据价格战中，而这场战争极大地惠及了消费者）正使流媒体获益。电商巨大将物流网组合起来，以最快的速度使得三线城市的消费者可以购买全球时尚品牌成为可能。消费信贷大潮的兴起令到更多印度人能买到更多的小玩意儿。

Insofar as it is the job of politicians to create a consumer class, successive Indian government shave largely failed. Businesses hoping the Indian middle class will provide their next spurt of growth should be under no illusion. Companies will have to work very hard to turn potential into profits.

政客们的工作就是在一定范围内制造消费阶层，历届政府都失败了。商人们期望印度中产阶级能为其带来井喷式增长应该不存任何幻想。这些公司将不得不努力工作以将潜力转变为利润。
