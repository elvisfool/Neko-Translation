Developing countries could get sick before they get rich. Policy can help

Improved human well-being is one of the modern era’s greatest triumphs. The age of plenty has also led to an unexpected global health crisis: two billion people are either overweight or obese. Developed countries have been especially susceptible to unhealthy weight gain, a trend that could be considered the price of abundance. However, developing countries are now facing a similar crisis.

改善人类的福祉是现代社会最伟大的胜利之一。富裕的时代也会导致全球健康危机：二十亿人不是超重就是肥胖。发达国家尤其容易受到体重增加的影响，这种趋势被认为是富足的代价。然而，发展中国家也面临着类似的危机。

Obesity rates have plateaued in high income countries but are accelerating elsewhere. The combined findings of UNICEF, the World Health Organisation and the World Bank showed that in 2016 Asia was home to half the world’s overweight children. One quarter were in Africa.

高收入国家的肥胖率已经趋于稳定，但是在其它地区却在增加。联合国儿童基金会，世界卫生组织以及世界银行联合调查结果显示，2016年全球有一半的超重儿童在亚洲。四分之一在非洲。

Residents of developing nation cities are increasingly susceptible to obesity, particularly amid the megatrends of urbanisation, globalisation, and industrialisation of food supply. According to India’s National Institute of Nutrition, over a quarter of urban-dwelling men and nearly half of women are overweight.

发展中国家城市的居民越来越容易患上肥胖症，特别在城市化，全球化以及工业化食品供应的大潮中。根据印度国家营养研究所的数据，超过四分之一的城市居住男性和将一半的女性体重超标。

The majority of the world’s future urbanisation is projected to occur in developing countries, particularly in Asia and Africa. As rural dwellers move to urban areas, easy access to cheap and convenient processed foods lures them into unhealthy diets.

世界上大多数未来的城市化进程预计会发生在发展中国家，特别是亚洲和非洲。随着农民搬到城市后，能容易获得廉价和方便加工的食物，这些诱使他们成为不健康饮食的一员。

This crisis will test the political resolve of governments that have historically focused on ending hunger. These governments must understand that the factors making cities convenient and productive also make their residents prone to obesity. Intelligent, focused policies are needed to effectively manage this emerging crisis.
这些危机将考验政府政治决心，这个政府一直以来致力于解决饥饿问题。政府必须明白，使城市变得便捷和富有成效的这些因素，也能使居民变得肥胖。要有效处理这一新兴危机，需要明智和有针对性的政策。

Urban lifestyles
城市生活方式

Urbanites enjoy a variety of culinary options, ranging from aisles of processed goods in supermarkets to scores of short-order street vendors. Additionally, international fast food chains are flourishing in developing countries. This is shifting dietary habits away from healthier traditional fare and towards fried foods and sugary drinks.

城里人享受各种各样的食物品种，从超市过道上已经处理好的食物到无数街头小贩的快餐。另外，全球快餐连锁店在发展中国家遍地开花。这些饮食习惯从更健康的传统食物向油炸食品和含糖饮料转变。

The health risks of such diets are compounded by the sedentary lifestyles of urban dwellers. The most recent Indian nutrition survey found that city-dwelling men and women work an average of roughly eight hours a day. Most are engaged in sedentary office jobs. Only about one quarter exercise.

城市居民久坐不动的生活方式加剧了这种饮食的健康风险。印度最新的营养调查发现，城市男性和女性居民每天大约工作8小时。大多数是在写字楼上班。仅有约四分之一是体力活。

People’s leisure time is also being monopolised by passive diversions like television, movies, and video games in the growing number of households able to afford such technologies.

人们的休闲时光也被诸如电视，电影以及视频游戏这样被动娱乐所垄断，有越来越多的家庭能够负担得起这样的技术消费。

The alarming implication of these trends is that developing countries may become sick before they get rich. That sickness may, in turn, cripple health systems.

这些令人担忧的趋势信号是发展中国家也许在变得富有之前使国民的健康受损。这些疾病，反过来，也许会削弱健康系统。

The yearly health care costs in Southeast Asia of obesity-related complications like diabetes and cardiovascular disease are already as high as US $10 billion. Obesity among China’s younger generation could cost US $724 billion in medical treatment by 2030. Such diseases are an added burden on countries already struggling to manage primary health care needs.

在南亚，与肥胖相关的，比如糖尿病和心血管疾病，每年医疗保健费用已经高达100亿美元。到2030年，中国年轻一代在肥胖的治疗上能达到7240亿美元。这些疾病给已经尽力控制初级医疗保健需求的国家增加了负担。

Policies related to taxation, urban design, education and awareness and the promotion of localised food systems may help control obesity at a lower cost than eventual medical treatment for an ageing and increasingly overweight population.

与政策相关的税收，城市规划，教育以及健康意识和推广本地食物系统可能有助于控制肥胖，比最终为老龄化和日益超重的人口提供医疗的成本要低。

Direct interventions
直接干预


Some governments have already experimented with direct interventions to control obesity, such as taxation on unhealthy foods and drinks. The US pioneered the soda tax movement. Thailand, Brunei, and Singapore have adopted similar measures. South Africa is likely to introduce a sugar tax beginning in April 2018.

一些国家已经用直接干预的办法尝试去控制肥胖，比如对不健康的食物和饮料进行征税。美国率先实行了碳酸饮料税收行为。泰国，文莱以及新加坡已经采用了相关的条例。南非有可能在2018年4月开始引入糖税。

Regulatory approaches have not stopped at taxation – or at sugar. In the United Kingdom, advertising rules prohibit the marketing of foods high in fat, salt and sugar to children younger than 16.

监管手段没有对糖停止征税。在英国，广告法禁止向16岁以下的儿童销售高脂肪，高盐和高糖的食物。

The city of Berkeley in California recognises that taxes alone are not enough to address obesity. Proceeds from the city’s sugar tax are used to support child nutrition and community health programmes. This underscores the importance of education and awareness.

在加州的柏克利市承认，单靠税收并不足以控制肥胖。城市所征收的糖税过去用于支持儿童营养和社区健康项目。这有助于强调教育和健康意识的重要性。

There is also promise in broader-reaching initiatives. Urban design holds significant power to reshape lifestyle patterns and public health. Improving the attractiveness of public space, the “walkability” of neighbourhoods and the quality of cycling infrastructure can draw residents out of their cars and living rooms.
在宽广的倡议中也有承诺。城市规划有着重塑生活模式和公共健康的巨大力量。改善公共空间对人们的吸引力，邻里间的“可步行性”以及自行车基础设施的质量都可以把居民从他们的汽车和起居室中吸引出来。

A recent study of urban neighbourhoods in Shanghai and Hangzhou found that middle-income residents living in less walkable neighbourhoods had significantly higher Body Mass Indices than both richer and poorer residents who lived in walkable neighbourhoods in urban China.

最近一项在上海和杭州的城市邻里的研究发现，居住在不宜步行社区中的中等收入居民，比居住在中国城市步行社区中较富有和较贫穷的居民有着较高的体重指数。

Finally, healthier lifestyles begin in grocery store aisles. Governments should encourage tighter connections between agricultural production systems, urban grocers and food vendors. Relationships with farmers in areas immediately adjacent to cities, in addition to the promotion of urban gardens, have been popular approaches in the US.

最后，更健康的生活方式始于杂货店的过道上。政府应该鼓励农产品系统，城市杂货铺和食品供应商之间加强联系。在美国，除了推广城市花园外，在毗邻城市的地区推动与农民的关系已经变得十分流行。

Such initiatives can also help urban residents better understand the mechanics of food sourcing. This raises awareness about the relationship between natural foods and healthy lifestyles. Even the preservation of culture around traditional foods can promote healthy alternatives.
这样的举措也能有助于城市居民更好的理解食物来源的原理。这能提高在自然食物和健康生活方式之间两者关系的认识。甚至能保留传统食物的文化，能促进发展健康食物的替代品。

Combining controls on unhealthy foods with policies that incentivise healthy eating and active lifestyles constitute a promising response to rising obesity rates. Addressing public health is a policy mandate for developing countries from both an economic and social point of view. To paraphrase the recent Global Nutrition Report, addressing obesity is a global imperative for releasing the brakes on development.

将不健康食物的控制与政策相结合，这些政策能激发人们认识健康的饮食和积极的生活方式，对不断攀升的肥胖率有着积极的回应。就经济和社会的角度而言，解决公共健康问题是发展中国家的一项政策任务。借用全球最近的全球营养报告，肥胖问题是经济发展的障碍，已经成为全球要解决的当务之急。
