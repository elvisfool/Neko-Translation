Donald Trump’s agenda in Asia is a mystery
川普的亚洲行程是个谜。

But he gets a little credit for showing up
但这次的出访确实干得不错

Nov 4th 2017| BEIJING, TOKYO AND WASHINGTON, DC

FOR those concerned about American neglect of Asia, it is an accomplishment of sorts that Donald Trump is coming to the region at all. A creature of habit, America’s president is uncomfortable spending nights away from his own bed. And now, with the first indictments in Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the election that put Mr Trump in office, foreign policy is likely to have fallen even lower down his list of priorities. Yet on November 3rd Mr Trump begins a 12-day trip, his longest foreign excursion as president and his first to Asia. He will take in (via Hawaii) Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.

对于那些担心美国忽略亚洲的人来说，唐纳·川普这次的访亚之行是一次多任务之旅。墨守成规的美国总统总喜欢待在国内。而现在，随着罗伯特·米勒斯关于川普在选举中的通俄门事件中第一份起诉书的调查，外交政策的优先度被降低了。但在11月3号，川普开始了12天出访，这是他任内最长的外交访问和首次亚洲之行。他将(途经夏威夷)到达日本，南韩，中国，越南和菲律宾。

The first rule in Asian politics, where form trumps content, is just showing up. So far, so promising. What is more, although one of Mr Trump’s first moves as president was to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a 12-country free-trade deal—“the greatest self-inflicted wound on American regional influence since the Vietnam war,” as Michael Green of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington puts it—little has yet come of Mr Trump’s threats to erect barriers to imports from Asian countries running surpluses with America (ie, nearly all of them). Nor has Mr Trump followed through on his
 vow to stop Japan and South Korea free-riding, as he saw it, on America’s defence guarantees.

亚洲政治的第一条法则——形式大于内容——正在显现。至今，这个法则依然畅通无阻。另外，川普作为总统的首次行程就是解决泛太平洋伙伴关系协定(TTP)，一个十二个国家的自由贸易协定——"自越战以来，对美国本土影响最大的自找的麻烦"，在华盛顿的战略和国际研究中心的迈克尔·格林将对这个协议——对川普来说威胁还不大——提高从亚洲各国进口的门槛，把盈余留给美国(比如，大部分的盈余)。川普也没有兑现阻止日本和韩国占便宜，在他看来，这是基于美国国防保障。

高尔夫和天然气

America’s relationships in Asia remain vulnerable to Mr Trump’s Twitter feed. But as Aaron Connelly of the Lowy Institute in Sydney points out, Mr Trump and the bomb-throwers who promised a radical shift to an “America First” approach to foreign policy have made little headway. He puts that down to inexperience, the president’s feeble grasp of foreign affairs, the easewith which he is distracted and his failure to fill important foreign-policy positions with fellow travellers (or, often, with anyone at  
 policy on Asia remains largely in the hands of centrists steeped in America’s long-standing alliances. Most notably, they believe in more or less the same approach—deterrence—as the previous administrations towards an increasingly troubling North Korea. American policy in Asia is on autopilot.

美国在亚洲的关系从川普的的推特出看得出是脆弱的。正如悉尼罗伊研究院亚伦·康纳利指出的那样，川普和他的那些承诺在外交政策上做出重大转变的无政府主义的幕僚在"美国优先"政策上，几乎没有什么进展。他指出的是，经验不足，总统在外交事务中的无力，在其它事务上的分心导致的轻视以及和那些出访者(或者说，经常和所有人)在重要外交立场的失败。导致的结果就是，对亚洲的政策很大程度上被中间派议员掌握，并且沉醉在美国长期以来对盟国的想象中。最明显的是，他们或多或少地相信用相同的办法——威胁——正如前几届政府对日益令人不安的北韩一样。美国对亚洲政策处在一个放任自流的状况中。

Some Asian leaders think they have the measure of Mr Trump. In Japan the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, intends everything to be sweetness and light. That starts with flattery, something Mr Abe understood from the start of his personal relationship with the American president. Mr Trump will learn that Tokyo’s department stores have stocked (exorbitantly marked-up) bottles from his Virginia winery to honour the visit. There will, of course, be golf. And Mr Abe will give Mr Trump trade goodies to take home, promising not only to buy liquefied natural gas from America but also to promote a network of terminals for its distribution across Asia.

某些亚洲领导人认为他们对川普有一些评价。日本首相安倍晋三期待所有一切都是美好和有希望的。用奉承作为开始，川普将会知道，东京的百货公司储存了(数量极多的)从他的维吉尼亚酿酒厂送来的葡萄酒，庆祝这次的访日之旅。当然，还会打高尔夫。安倍不会让川普空手而归，承诺不仅从美国购买液化天然气，而且提升分布在亚洲的终端网络。

Mr Abe’s aims are twofold. One is to prevent Mr Trump’s hostility to multilateral trade deals from poisoning the region’s trading relationships. Mr Abe is pushing hard to preserve TPP as a regional free-trade grouping without America. Its 11 surviving members gathered outside Tokyo shortly before Mr Trump was due there.

安倍有两个目的。一个是阻止川普对多边贸易产生的不利因素，以免对该地区贸易关系造成影响。日本作为一个没有美国支持的地区性自由贸易组织，安倍正努力维持TPP对该国的影响。在川普来访之前，11个成员国聚集在东京郊外。

North Korea is the other pressing issue. As Japanese strategists see it, the North’s rapid development of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking American cities has made America as worried about an attack as Japan and South Korea, which have long been vulnerable to one. Mr Abe has just fought and won a general election partly on a platform of standing up to the rogue state. He is likely to push for changes to Japan’s pacifist constitution that legitimise Japan’s armed forces. To Mr Trump, he will present this as evidence that Japan is doing its bit, and as an inducement for America to continue to provide security and to pursue unflinching deterrence against the North.

北韩是另一个需要紧迫解决的问题。正如日本军事观察家认为的那样，北韩快速发展的洲际弹导导弹具有打击美国城市的能力，使得日本和南韩与美国一样的担心，北韩对于美国来说一直都是弱小的。安倍刚刚赢得一场大选，在一定程度上是因为站在流氓国家的立场上。他可能会修改使日本军队合法化的和平宪法。对于川普来说，他会认为这是日本本该做的份内事的证据，并且作为美国继续提供安全保障和继续不断地对北韩进行威慑的一个诱因。

Mr Trump’s Japan visit will probably go well. But his unpredictability still worries Japanese strategists. At least rhetorically, he has lurched between wildly different approaches to North Korea, at times suggesting that he could resolve all his differences with Kim Jong Un over a hamburger and at others implying he was ready to launch a pre-emptive attack. For now, Mr Abe’s mantra is, hold Mr Trump close.

川普的访日之旅可能会很顺利。但是日本的军事观察家们为他的变化无常感到担忧。至少在语言表达上，他徘徊在对待北韩截然不同的态度上，有时他会暗示只需吃个汉堡包便能解决与金正恩之间的纷争，有时对其他人暗示他会先发制人对北韩进行攻击。而现在，
安倍的口头禅就是，抱住川普的大腿。

Moon Jae-in, South Korea’s new president, intends to pursue the same approach, offering Mr Trump a state visit with all the trimmings. Yet, in contrast to Mr Abe, his personal relationship with Mr Trump is not easy-going. That is a concern to Mr Moon’s advisers. Though no sandal-wearing leftie—Mr Moon served in the special forces, and calls for stronger defences against the North—his progressive cast does not endear him to Mr Trump. Many of his countrymen are alarmed at the American president’s loose talk of pre-emptive war against the North, and think diplomacy should be given much more of a chance. Mr Moon’s people are nervous about what Mr Trump might say or tweet while in the country. Meanwhile, Mr Trump’s threats to tear up the five-year-old United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement undermine the assurances of solidarity made by his national-security team.

南韩的新总统，文在寅也打算用同样的方式，用一切的准备来迎接川普的国事访问。然而与安倍相比，他与川普的关系并不是那么好。这使得文在寅的顾问们感到担忧。尽管没有左撇子穿的木屐——文在寅曾在特种部队服过役，并呼吁对北韩采取强硬态度—他做出的改变并没有讨川普的欢心。韩国人在美国总统川普提到对北韩进行先发制人的战争时感到恐慌，并认为通过外交手段应该会有更多解决问题的机会。韩国人非常紧张当川普在韩国时会说什么或者在推特上写些什么。同时，川普威胁要撕毁五年期的美韩自由贸易协定，逐渐破坏由他的国家安全团队制定的保证两国团结一致的协议。

This equivocation is all the more striking because China seems to be trying to repair relations with South Korea. For months it has bullied the South for installing American anti-missile defences known as THAAD. Rather than accepting that they were needed to counter North Korea, China argued, solipsistically , that they were aimed at it. China punished South Korea with boycotts of its products and a ban on Chinese tour groups visiting South Korea.

这些模棱两可的话更能引起注意，因为中国似乎想修复与南韩的关系。几个月来，中国威胁南韩安装美国的反导弹防御系统萨德。而不是承认他们也需要对抗北韩。中国以自我的态度认为，他们的目的达到了。南韩的产品受到抵制并且禁止中国旅行社到南韩。

But China’s president, Xi Jinping, has emerged from the five-yearly Communist Party congress with his authority cemented. Immediately afterwards, his government moved to restore cordial relations with South Korea. Mr Xi is due to meet Mr Moon on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) summit, a pow-wow in Vietnam on November 10th and 11th that Mr Trump is also attending. Mr Moon will affirm that South Korea does not plan more THAAD batteries for now, and will not join any wider security initiative aimed at China. Mr Xi might, in other words, be able to drive a bit of a wedge between America and South Korea.

但中国国家主席习进平在五年一度的共产党代表大会上，权力得到了巩固，紧接着，他的政府与南韩恢复了友好关系。习近平将会在亚太经合组织（APEC）期间与文在寅会面，会议将在11月10至11日在越南举行，届时川普也会出席。文在寅将表示，南韩目前不会计划布署更多的萨德系统，并且将不会加入针对中国的更广泛的安全计划中。习进平，换言之，也许会挑拨美韩两国的关系。

As for Mr Trump’s stop in Beijing, flattery will prevail there, too. Mr Xi has prepared a reception fit for a monarch (China’s ambassador to Washington calls it a “state-visit-plus”). Mr Trump, who seems to get along well with strongmen, appears in awe of Mr Xi’s power. He referred to him as “the king of China” last month.

当川普访京之际，奉承也在继续。习进平准备了一个帝王式的接待仪式（中国驻华盛顿大使称之为“国事访问+）。川普看起来似乎与一个铁腕相处得不错，并且对习近平的权力感到敬畏。上个月，川普把他称之为”中国之王“。

In truth, Mr Xi can afford to humour Mr Trump, once a China hawk, in part because Mr Trump has not been very hawkish in his dealings with China. Instead, Mr Trump has cosied up to Mr Xi, apparently in the hope that he would bring Chinese pressure to bear on North Korea. The American president has praised China for enforcing new UN sanctions barring North Korea from exporting textiles and limiting its imports of oil. Yet there is little sign that China is willing to take the one step that might change North Korea’s behaviour: cutting off its oil supply altogether.

事实上，习进平也有能力满足川普，曾经对中国实行强硬作风的川普，部分原因是他没有在对华交往中表现出来。相反，川普对习进平表示出来友好，显然他是希望中国能对北韩进行施压。美国总统高度赞扬中国，执行联合国对北韩的新一轮制裁，包括禁止出口纺织品到限制进口石油。然而几乎没有迹象表明中国愿意为改变北韩的行为迈出一步：完全地切断对其的石油供应。

As for trade, American business in China is agape at the skimpy agenda the administration has crafted for the trip. China is expected to announce some energy investments in Texas and the Virgin Islands. There might be orders for passenger planes, along with concessions on American credit cards, long in the works. But this would be small stuff. Instead of the American side bringing a list of specific demands, it is asking for a broad attitudinal shift by the Chinese government (ie, stop giving Chinese firms an “unfair advantage”). American bureaucrats, at Mr Trump’s behest, are conducting a formal investigation of predatory Chinese trade practices, but it is not due to report for months. No wonder China’s leaders deem the bilateral relationship to be as good as it has ever been—“a blessing to the world”, as the People’s Daily, a state-run newspaper, puts it. 

至于贸易方面，在华的美国商界都感到意外，因为在这次行程中被置于微不足道的日程安排上。中国预计会宣布在维吉尼亚州和维京群岛有一些能源投资。也许会有客机的订单，以及美国信用卡的特许经营权，这是两国一直在推动的事情。不过这些都是小事情。相反，美方提出了一些具体要求的事项，要求中国政府作出明显的态度转变（比如，停止给中国企业某些“倾斜政策”）。在川普的要求下，美国官僚开始对中国掠夺性经济行为正常开展调查，但这不是因为几个月来的调查报告造成的。难怪中国的领导人认为双边关系就像中国国家媒体人民日报——对世界的祝福——所说的那样。


Mr Trump’s trip is a missed opportunity. As Douglas Paal of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace argues, the point at which Mr Xi has consolidated his power would have been the right one for an American president to explain how his country wants to preserve its interests in Asia without bringing on a clash. A discussion could have involved contingencies on the Korean peninsula, and avoiding conflict in the South China Sea. An administration more clear-eyed about what is at stake for America might have taken more seriously China’s “belt-and-road” initiative, linking Asia by land and sea to the Middle East and beyond.

川普的出访错过了一些机会。正如卡耐基国际和平基金会的道格拉斯·帕尔所言，问题在于习进平已经巩固了他的权力，这是正确的事情，对川普解释为什么他的国家希望能在亚洲不引起冲突的情况下能保护其利益。讨论可能会涉及到朝鲜半岛以及避免在南中国海的冲突。政府应该更加清楚地看到，美国可能会更认真地对待“一带一路”战略，被陆地和海洋连接亚洲到中东以及其它地区。


Possibly, Mr Trump will offer a competing vision in the coming days along the lines proposed last month by his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, of a “free and open Indo-Pacific”, in which Australia, India, Japan and even Vietnam will help America counter China’s maritime expansion. But the idea is bankrupt if America is against free and open trade. What is more, Mr Trump has decided to cut his Asia trip short and so will miss the East Asia Summit in Manila, the main annual get-together for the region’s leaders. China will send its prime minister, if not Mr Xi.

也许，川普会按照他的国务卿雷克斯·戴纳森在上月提出的建议，提供一个有竞争力的愿景，“自由和开放的太平洋地区”，其中澳洲，印度，日本甚至越南将会帮助美国对抗中国的海上扩张。但假如美国是反对自由和开放贸易的话，计划就会失败。而且，川普决定缩短亚洲行程，同时错过在马尼拉的东亚峰会，这是该区域主要的年底聚会。如果不是习进平出席的话，也许会由总理代替。
