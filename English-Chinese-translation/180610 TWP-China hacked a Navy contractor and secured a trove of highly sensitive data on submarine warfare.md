Chinese government hackers have compromised the computers of a Navy contractor, stealing massive amounts of highly sensitive data related to undersea warfare — including secret plans to develop a supersonic anti-ship missile for use on U.S. submarines by 2020, according to American officials.  

中国黑客入侵了海军承包商的电脑，窃取大量与海底战有关的高敏感度数据——根据美国官员透露，包括到2020年在美国核潜艇上发展超音速反舰导弹的秘密计划。

The breaches occurred in January and February, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation. The hackers targeted a contractor who works for the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, a military organization headquartered in Newport, R.I., that conducts research and development for submarines and underwater weaponry.

官方称，入侵曾发生在一月和二月，要求匿名讨论正在进行的调查。黑客针对为海军水下作战中心的承包商，总部设在罗德岛新港的一个军事组织，承包商为核潜艇和海底战进行研究和开发。

The officials did not identify the contractor.

官方没有透露承包商的身份。

Taken were 614 gigabytes of material relating to a closely held project known as Sea Dragon, as well as signals and sensor data, submarine radio room information relating to cryptographic systems, and the Navy submarine development unit’s electronic warfare library.


有614G数据与一个被称为“海龙”项目有关的信息被窃取，还有信号和传感器信息，核潜艇无信电室与加密系统相关的信息，以及海军核潜艇开发部门的电子战图书馆。

The Washington Post agreed to withhold certain details about the compromised missile project at the request of the Navy, which argued that their release could harm national security.

 华盛顿邮报应海军要求，同意保留某些被入侵的导弹计划细节，这些细节的透露会危害国家安全。

The data stolen was of a highly sensitive nature despite being housed on the contractor’s unclassified network. The officials said the material, when aggregated, could be considered classified, a fact that raises concerns about the Navy’s ability to oversee contractors tasked with developing ¬cutting-edge weapons.

被窃的高敏感数据尽管放置在承包商非保密网络中。官员透，当材料汇总起来的时候，被视为机密材料。实事上，海军对承包商发展尖端武器任务的监督能力令人担忧。

The breach is part of China’s long-running effort to blunt the U.S. advantage in military technology and become the preeminent power in East Asia. The news comes as the Trump administration is seeking to secure Beijing’s support in persuading North Korea to give up nuclear weapons, even as tensions persist between the United States and China over trade and defense matters.

中国长期以来试图削弱美国在军事技术的优势，黑客入侵是其中之一，并同时成为东亚的超级大国。这一消息来自特朗普政府，其正在寻求北京的支持，说服北韩放弃核武器，当中美之间在贸易和防御问题上的持续紧张关系的时候。

The Navy is leading the investigation into the breach with the assistance of the FBI, officials said. The FBI declined to comment.

官员称，海军在FBI的协助下，正对入侵开展调查。FIB对此事不予置评。

On Friday, the Pentagon inspector general’s office said that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had asked it to review contractor cybersecurity issues arising from The Post’s story.

在周五，五角大楼监察长办公室称，国防部长吉姆马蒂斯已经要求五角大楼审《华盛顿邮报》中提到的承包商网络安全问题。

Cmdr. Bill Speaks, a Navy spokesman, said, “There are measures in place that require companies to notify the government when a ‘cyber incident’ has occurred that has actual or potential adverse effects on their networks that contain controlled unclassified information.”

海军发言人，司令员比尔称，“措施包含控制非保密信息，这些措施要求发生对承包商网络有实际或者潜在副作用的“网络事件”时，公司需要通知政府。”

Speaks said that “it would be inappropriate to discuss further details at this time.”

发言人称，“在这个时候谈论下一步细节不太合适。”

Altogether, details on hundreds of mechanical and software systems were compromised — a significant breach in a critical area of warfare that China has identified as a priority, both for building its own capabilities and challenging those of the United States.

尽管，数以千计在电脑和软件系统被入侵的细节——中国将其在战争关键领域的重大突破视为首要任务，一方面是建立自己的能力，另一方面是挑战美国。

“It’s very disturbing,” said former senator James M. Talent (R-Mo.), who is a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. “But it’s of a piece with what the Chinese have been doing. They are completely focused on getting advanced weapons technology through all kinds of means. That includes stealing secrets from our defense contractors.” Talent had no independent knowledge of the breach.

“令人不安”,前参议员詹姆斯M.泰伦特表示，他是美中经济安全审核委员会的成员之一。“中国一直在从事这些事情，他们通过各种手段，完全专注于先进的武器技术，包括从我们的国防承包商中窃取机密。”。泰伦特对入侵并没有太多个人见解。


Undersea priority
海底首要任务

The Sea Dragon project is an initiative of a special Pentagon office stood up in 2012 to adapt existing U.S. military technologies to new applications. The Defense Department, citing classification levels, has released little information about Sea Dragon other than to say that it will introduce a “disruptive offensive capability” by “integrating an existing weapon system with an existing Navy platform.” The Pentagon has requested or used more than $300 million for the project since late 2015 and has said it plans to start underwater testing by September.

海龙项目是一个特别的五角大楼办公室在2012年建立的一个倡议，将现有美国军事技术适用于新的应用。国防部——援引分类等级——除了谈到会“将现有武器系统和现有的海军平台相整合”引入“破坏性进攻能力。”外，只发布关于海龙的少量信息。自2015年底以来，五角大楼要求或使用5亿美元在这个项目上，并表示在9月底进行水下测试。

Military experts fear that China has developed capabilities that could complicate the Navy’s ability to defend U.S. allies in Asia in the event of a conflict with China.

军事专家担忧，当与中国发生冲突时，中国已经具备的军事能力，使美国海军在亚洲保护其盟友的能力复杂化。

The Chinese are investing in a range of platforms, including ¬quieter submarines armed with increasingly sophisticated weapons and new sensors, Adm. P hilip S. Davidson said during his April nomination hearing to lead U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. And what they cannot develop on their own, they steal — often through cyberspace, he said.

中国正投资一系列平台，包括有日益先进的精密武器以及新的传感器的更安静的潜艇武装。海军上将P.菲利普S.大卫森称，在他四月的提名听证会上将领导美国印度-太平洋司令部。如果中国不能发展自己的国防力量，他们便去盗窃——通常利用网络。”他表示。

“One of the main concerns that we have,” he told the Senate Armed Services Committee, “is ¬cyber and penetration of the dot-com networks, exploiting technology from our defense contractors, in some instances.” 

他告诉参议院军事委员会，“我们关注的其中一个问题是，网络和互联网网络的渗透，在某些情况下，利用我们国防承包商的技术。”

In February, Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats testified that most of the detected Chinese cyber operations against U.S. industry focus on defense contractors or tech firms supporting government networks.
In recent years, the United States has been scrambling to develop new weapons or systems that can counter a Chinese naval buildup that has targeted perceived weaknesses in the U.S. fleet. Key to the American advantage in any faceoff with China on the high seas in Asia will be its submarine fleet. 

在二月份，国家情报主任丹尔儿考特斯证实了，大部分被发现的针对美国工业的中国网络操作，都是针对国防承包商或者支持政府网络的技术公司。近年来，美国一直致力于发展能与中国海军相抗衡的新武器或系统，中国海军已经瞄准美国舰队的弱点。在亚洲，与中国在公海的对峙，美国优势关键在于潜艇舰队。

“U.S. naval forces are going to have a really hard time operating in that area, except for submarines, because the Chinese don’t have a lot of anti-submarine warfare capability,” said Bryan Clark, a naval analyst at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. “The idea is that we are going to rely heavily on submarines in the early effort of any conflict with the Chinese.”

“美国海军在这一区域的行为将会非常的困难，除了潜艇外，因为中国有很多反潜艇作战能力，”，一位在战略预算评估中心的海军分析师布莱尔克拉克表示。“我们的想法是，在与中国发生冲突的前期，我们将重度依赖潜艇。”

China has made closing the gap in undersea warfare one of its three top military priorities, and although the United States still leads the field, China is making a concerted effort to diminish U.S. superiority.

中国将缩小海底战的差距列为三大军事首要任务，尽管美国在这一领域的技术领先，中国正努力消弱美国的优势。

“So anything that degrades our comparative advantage in undersea warfare is of extreme significance if we ever had to execute our war plans for dealing with China,” said James Stavridis, dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and a retired admiral who served as supreme allied commander at NATO. 

“假如我们必须执行与中国的战争计划，某些降低我们在海底战中的相对优势的事情都极其重要。”，詹姆斯斯塔里夫表示，他是斯夫塔大学弗莱彻法律外交学校主任及退休上将， 曾在北约担任最高盟军司令。

The U.S. military let its anti-ship weaponry languish after the Cold War ended because with the Soviet Union’s collapse, the Navy no longer faced a peer competitor on the seas. But the rapid modernization and buildup of the Chinese navy in recent years, as well as Russia’s resurgent forces at sea, have prompted the Pentagon to renew heavy investment in technologies to sink enemy warships.

在冷战结束后，由于 苏维埃的解体，美国军队的反艇武器日式渐微，海军在海上不再有竞争对手，但是近年来中国海军的快速现代化建设，同时俄罗斯在海上力量的复苏，促使五角大楼在技术上投入重金，以击沉敌舰。

The introduction of a supersonic anti-ship missile on U.S. Navy submarines would make it more difficult for Chinese warships to maneuver. It also would augment a suite of other anti-ship weapons that the U.S. military has been developing in recent years. 

美国海军潜艇超音速反舰导弹的介绍将会令中国舰队的演习面临更多困难。这也会增强美军近年来开发的一系列其它反艇武器。

Ongoing breaches

正在发生的黑客入侵

For years, Chinese government hackers have siphoned information on the U.S. military, underscoring the challenge the Pentagon faces in safeguarding details of its technological advances. Over the years, the Chinese have snatched designs for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter; the advanced Patriot PAC-3 missile system; the Army system for shooting down ballistic missiles known as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense; and the Navy’s new Littoral Combat Ship, a small surface vessel designed for near-shore operations, according to previous reports prepared for the Pentagon.

这些年来，中国政府黑客在美国军事上窃取了信息，凸显了五角大楼在保护其技术进展的细节所面临的挑战。多年来，中国已经抢夺了F-35联合攻击战争机的设计；先进的爱国者PAC-3导弹系统；陆军击落弹导导弹系统，称为终端高空区域防御系统；以及海军最新的近海战舰，一种小型水面船舱，用于近岸操作，根据之前为五角大楼所准备的报告。

In some cases, suspected Chinese breaches appear to have resulted in copycat technologies, such as the drones China has produced that mimic U.S. unmanned aircraft.

有时候，疑似中国的入侵行为似乎导致一些模仿技术的出现，比如，中国制造的的无人机，那是模仿制造的美国无人驾驶飞机。

Speaks, the Navy spokesman, said: “We treat the broader issue of cyber-intrusion against our contractors very seriously. If such an intrusion were to occur, the appropriate parties would be looking at the specific incident, taking measures to protect current information, and mitigating the impacts that might result from any information that might have been compromised.”

海军发言人称：“我们非常认真地对待针对承包商更广泛的网络入侵问题，假如入侵再次发生，有关各方将关注这一特定事件，采取措施保护当前的信息以及减轻可能由于任何被窃取信息所带来的影响。

The Pentagon’s Damage Assessment Management Office has conducted an assessment of the damage, according to the U.S. officials. The Office of the Secretary of Defense declined to comment.

据美国官员声称，五角大楼的损失评估管理办公室已经对损失进行了评估。国防部长办公室对此不予置评。

Theft of an electronic warfare library, Stavridis said, could give the Chinese “a reasonable idea of what level of knowledge we have about their specific [radar] platforms, electronically and potentially acoustically, and that deeply reduces our level of comfort if we were in a close undersea combat situation with China.”

斯里塔夫说，一个电子战图书馆被盗，可以给中国“一个正确的推测，我们对特定雷达平台的了解，电子，潜力以及声学方面的。这将大大降低我们与中国在海底近距离作战的安全度。”

Signals and sensor data is also valuable in that it presents China with the opportunity to “know when we would know at what distance we would be able to detect their submarines,” he said — again a key factor in undersea battles.

有价值的信号和传感器数据也能给中国带来机会，“得知什么时候我们会知道，在什么距离我们会探测到他们的潜艇，”他表示——这又是海底战的一个重要因素。

Investigators say the hack was carried out by the Chinese Ministry of State Security, a civilian spy agency responsible for counterintelligence, foreign intelligence and domestic political security. The hackers operated out of an MSS division in the province of Guangdong, which houses a major foreign hacking department.

调查者认为，黑客行动是由中国国家安全部实施的，一个负责反间谍，外国情报以及国内政治安全的民用间谍机构。黑客在广东省一个MSS部门工作，在那里有一个主要的外国黑客部门。

Although the Chinese People’s Liberation Army is far better-known than the MSS when it comes to hacking, the latter’s personnel are more skilled and much better at hiding their tracks, said Peter Mattis, a former analyst in the CIA counterintelligence center. The MSS, he said, hacks for all forms of intelligence: foreign, military and commercial.

说到黑客的时候，尽管中国人民解放军比MSS有名，后者的工作人员更有技巧和更好地隐藏他们的踪迹，前中央情报局反情报中心分析师彼特马蒂斯表示。他说，MSS入侵了所有形式的情报：外国的，军方的以及商业界的。

In September 2015, in a bid to avert economic sanctions, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged to President Barack Obama that China would refrain from conducting commercial cyberespionage against the United States. Following the pact, China appeared to have curtailed much, although not all, of its hacking activity against U.S. firms, including by the People’s Liberation Army.

在2015年的9月，为了避免经济制裁，中国主席习近平向奥巴马承诺，中国将避免对美国从事商业网络间碟活动。在协议下，中国似乎缩减了不少——尽管不是全部——针对美国公司的黑客活动，包括人民解决军。

Both China and the United States consider spying on military technology to fall outside the pact. “The distinction we’ve always made is there’s a difference between conducting espionage in order to protect national security and conduct military operations, and the theft of intellectual property for the benefit of companies inside your country,” said Michael Daniel, the White House cybersecurity coordinator under Obama.

中美两国都考虑对军事技术进行间谍活动而不受协议的约束。“一直以来我们所做的区分是不同的，在于我们从事间谍活动是为了保护国家安全以及从事军事行动，还是窃取知识产权为了你们国家的公司受益，奥巴马政府的白宫网络安全协调员迈克儿丹尼尔表示。
