A second thought

第二次思想运动

Xi Jinping’s thinking is ranked alongside Mao’s

习近平思想写入党章，比肩毛泽东


Does this mean no one can challenge him?

这意味着没人能挑战他吗？

THE constitution of the Chinese Communist Party 
defines what it means to be a party member and lists the organisation’s core beliefs .On October 24th a 
new principle was added to it: “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era”—quite a mouthful. Xinhua, a government news agency, said the change was approved at the end of a weeklong party congress, an event that takes place every five years. Party leaders had been parroting the cumbersome phrase for several days since Mr Xi, who is the party’s general secretary as well as president, first mentioned it (albeit without his own name attached) on the opening day of the gathering. Bill Bishop, an American China-watcher, says he writes it as XJPTSCCNE “to avoid getting carpal tunnel syndrome”.

中国共产党党章明确了党员的义务和罗列出组织的核心价值。在10月24日，党章增加了一项新的内容：“习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想”——很长的一个句子。中国官方媒体新华社报道，党章的修改将在每五年一次，在为期一周的党代会结束时通过。党内官员们不断地重复这句话好些天了，自从十九大召开的第一天，习近平作为党书记和主席，第一次提到这句话的时候起(尽管里面并没有他的名字)。美中观察家比尔.比硕把这句话让人拗口的话索性缩写为"XJPTSCCNE"。

Talk of theory and whether someone is named in a document might sound recondite. But this has huge implications because it invests Mr Xi with more power than any Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. He is the first living leader to be mentioned in the party’s charter since Mao. Deng Xiaoping’s name is also in the constitution but this was an honour accorded him only after he died in 1997. Mr Xi’s two predecessors, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, are not named. Moreover, Mr Xi’s thinking uses the same term in Chinese (sixiang) as the one in Mao Zedong Thought. Deng in contrast contributed only a “theory” (lilun), a less elevated term. No one can have more ideological authority than Mr Xi. The person has become the party in a way China has not seen since Mao.

探讨理论和是否以某人的名字命名写入党章听起来似乎不太起眼。但是却有着巨大的影响，因为这意味着习近平自毛邓以来掌握了比别其他领导人更多的权力。他是自毛泽东时代以来，首位在世时以自己名字写入党章的领导人。邓小平的名字也出现在党章里，不过这是在他1997年去世时的给予他的荣誉。习近平的两名前任，胡锦涛和江泽民并没有以名字命名。此外，习近平用了汉语里和毛泽东同等的用词(思想)，而邓小平只是用了级别稍低的词，"理论"。没人比习近平拥有更多的意识权威了。自从毛泽东时代以来，没有谁以这样的方式成为党的权威。

Mr Xi has made influential enemies during his first five years as party chief, notably the allies and clients of the hundreds of influential officials he has had arrested for corruption. He has also complained repeatedly that officials lower down the bureaucracy are stymying his orders. This could change, because to oppose him now would be regarded more than ever as opposition to the party itself. In principle, it could make decision-making in China smoother. But it raises the risk that underlings will tell Mr Xi only what they think he wants to hear, and increase the chances of bad policymaking.

习近平作为一党之主，习近平在他执政的头五年造就了一些有影响力的政敌，尤其是许多手握大权的同袍和下属被他以腐败的名义拘捕。他也常常抱怨懒政怠政令他的执政受阻。这一切也许会得以改变，因为现在反对他的人被当作是反对政党的人。原则上来说，这会更加快速地制定决策。但是这也存在风险，下级会让习进平听到顺耳之言以及增加一些制定不良政策的机会。

It also makes the question of the succession moot. By precedent, the general secretary should serve two five-year terms. Mr Xi’s run out in 2022. Under the rules that used to govern Chinese politics, he would be expected to signal his choice of successor at a meeting of the Central Committee that is due to be held on October 25th. The candidate would normally be in the new Politburo Standing Committee, or inner sanctum of politics, that will be unveiled after the brief gathering. Rumours are rife that Wang Qishan, the chief graft-buster and close ally of Mr Xi, has been dropped from the Central Committee, and therefore will not be included in the new line-up. There had been speculation that Mr Xi might keep him in place, even though he has passed the normal retirement age of 68.

这也会让十九大产生很多的问题。按照惯例，总书记可以连任两届，习进平的任期到2022年。在过去中国执政的潜规则下，习进平理应在25号召开的中央委员会的会议上挑选继任者。坊间则流传着习进平的反腐英雄和亲密盟友，王歧山不会进入中央委会员，同时也不会入常。有猜测认为习进平对他另有安排，尽管他已经过了正常的68岁退休年龄。

It is not clear how much it matters now who is chosen to succeed Mr Xi, or whether he has anyone in mind. With his name in the constitution, he must be the ultimate arbiter of authority as long as he is alive, since he—along with Marx, Lenin, Mao and Deng—defines what it is to be a good Chinese Communist.

谁会是习进平的下任的重要性或者他有没有人选，现在还不清楚。随着他的名字进入党章，只要他还活着，可以肯定他会一揽大权，因为他会和马克思，列宁，毛泽东和邓小平一样，定义了什么才是好的中国共产党。
