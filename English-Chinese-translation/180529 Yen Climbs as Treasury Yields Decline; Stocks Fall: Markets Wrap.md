Italian political troubles hit the euro, spur risk-off mood

意大利政局不稳影响欧元，各方寻求资产避险方式

Oil retreats further, with West Texas crude at six-week lows

随着西德州原油六周内持续低位，油价进一步下跌

Ten-year Treasury yields fell, taking the dollar down against the yen, after Italy’s political impasse triggered a risk-off mood in holiday-hit markets. Oil prices retreated further, sending West Texas crude to its lowest in six weeks.

意大利的政治僵局在假日市场引发了资产避险情绪后，十年期美国国债收益率下跌，导致美元对日元走低。石油价格进一步回落，将西德州原油价格降至六周来最低点。


Stocks declined, with benchmarks heading lower in Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong. Italy’s bonds and stocks tumbled overnight, and the euro weakened, with the country poised for fresh elections following the failure to set up a government. Ten-year Treasury yields fell below 2.90 percent for the first time this month, and U.S. equity futures slipped.

随着日本，南韩以及香港的基准指数下跌拖累亚洲股市受挫。意大利债券和股票一夜暴跌，随着该国重组政府失败后准备新一轮选举，欧元走低。十年期美国国债收益率跌至本月首次新低2.90，美国股指期货下滑。

Investors have started the week with geopolitics to the fore. U.S. negotiations with North Korea have proved unpredictable, and political turmoil in Italy and -- to a lesser extent -- Spain have refreshed memories of the euro zone’s woes of the past decade. Pro- and anti-European forces are at loggerheads in Italy where another election is expected as early as September after parties have failed to form a government since a March poll.

投资者本周开始关注地缘政治。美国与北韩的谈判充满变数，意大利的政局骚动——就小范围而言——西班牙在欧元区过去十年里的困境记忆犹新。亲欧与反欧阵营在意大利针锋相对，自从三月政党组建政府失败后，在九月初会有另一场选举。

“These developments are concerning,” Alessio de Longis, a New York-based portfolio manager at Oppenheimer Funds Inc., told Bloomberg Television in regard to Italy’s political landscape. “The market has taken a completely different tone, it no longer believes what the parties are saying. The markets will be really unable to move forward into a different narrative until these elections are out of the way.”


奥本海默基金公司驻纽约的投资组合基金经理Alessio de Longis向彭博电视表示，“市场和政局的发展是相关的,” 关于意大利的政治版图，“市场已经投了不信任票，不再相信政党那一套说法。在选举结束前，市场将不能就动荡的政局做出决定。”
