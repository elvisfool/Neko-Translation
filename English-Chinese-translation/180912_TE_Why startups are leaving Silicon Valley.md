“LIKE Florence in the Renaissance.” That is a common description of what it is like to live in Silicon Valley. America’s technology capital has an outsize influence on the world’s economy, stockmarkets and culture. This small portion of land running from San Jose to San Francisco is home to three of the world’s five most valuable companies. Giants such as Apple, Facebook, Google and Netflix all claim Silicon Valley as their birthplace and home, as do trailblazers such as Airbnb, Tesla and Uber. The Bay Area has the 19th-largest economy in the world, ranking above Switzerland and Saudi Arabia.

"就像文化复兴进的佛罗伦萨。”这是对生活在硅谷日常的普通写照。美国的技术资本已经对世界经济、股票市场以及文化产生了巨大的影响。从圣何塞到旧金山这一小片土地拥有世界上五分之三最有价值的公司。诸如苹果、脸书、谷歌以及Netflix都认为硅谷是其创始地，其它像爱彼家、特斯拉以及优步也同样这样认为。这座山湾是世界上第十九大经济体，排名在瑞士和沙特之上。

“
The Valley is not just a place. It is also an idea. Ever since Bill Hewlett and David Packard set up in a garage nearly 80 years ago, it has been a byword for innovation and ingenuity. It has been at the centre of several cycles of Schumpeterian destruction and regeneration, in silicon chips, personal computers, software and internet services. Some of its inventions have been ludicrous: internet-connected teapots, or an app that sold people coins to use at laundromats. But others are world-beaters: microprocessor chips, databases and smartphones all trace their lineage to the Valley.

“这座山谷不仅仅只是一个位置。也是创意之地。自从比尔·休利特和大卫·帕卡特在80年前建了一个修车厂以来，在硅芯片、个人电脑、软件以及互联网服务中，这里已经成为了创新和独特的代名词。 其中有些发明特别有意思：连接互联网的茶壶又或者卖硬币给人们在自助洗衣店使用的App.但其它的大佬 们如微处理芯片、数据库以及智能手机，也能在这里追溯到它们的身影。

Its combination of engineering expertise, thriving business networks, deep pools of capital, strong universities and a risk-taking culture have made the Valley impossible to clone, despite many attempts to do so. There is no credible rival for its position as the world’s pre-eminent innovation hub. But there are signs that the Valley’s influence is peaking (see Briefing). If that were simply a symptom of much greater innovation elsewhere, it would be cause for cheer. The truth is unhappier.

这里结合了工程专业知识、繁荣的商业网络、大量的资金、名校以及冒险精神使得硅谷在别的地方难以复制，尽管有过很多的尝试。作为世界优秀的创新之都，对于硅谷而言没有什么竞争对手。但是可以看到硅谷的影响力正在下跌。假如这是其它地方更好的创新之地的表现的话，令人鼓舞。然而事实并非如此。

Silicon Plateau
硅高原

First, the evidence that something is changing. Last year more Americans left the county of San Francisco than arrived. According to a recent survey, 46% of respondents say they plan to leave the Bay Area in the next few years, up from 34% in 2016. So many startups are branching out into new places that the trend has a name, “Off Silicon Valleying”. Peter Thiel, perhaps the Valley’s most high-profile venture capitalist, is among those upping sticks. Those who stay have broader horizons: in 2013 Silicon Valley investors put half their money into startups outside the Bay Area; now it is closer to two-thirds.

首先，事实表明有些情况发生了变化。去年，离开的人比到三蕃市的人还多。根据最新的调查，从2016年的34%上升到46%的调查对象表示，将计划在未来离开湾区。许多新创公司正在去新地方拓展业务，新地方称之为“离开硅谷”。彼特·泰尔——也许是硅谷知名度最高的风险资金——也是其中迁徙者之一。那些留下来的人具有更广阔的视野：在2013年硅谷的投资者们将其一半的资金投在硅谷以外的新创公司身上；现在这个数字接近三分之二。

The reasons for this shift are manifold, but chief among them is the sheer expense of the Valley. The cost of living is among the highest in the world. One founder reckons young startups pay at least four times more to operate in the Bay Area than in most other American cities. New technologies, from quantum computing to synthetic biology, offer lower margins than internet services, making it more important for startups in these emerging fields to husband their cash. All this is before taking into account the nastier features of Bay Area life: clogged traffic, discarded syringes and shocking inequality.

改变的原因是多方面的，但是主要的原因是硅谷的费用。生活成本是世界最高的。一名创始人估算，一家新创公司至少支付比美国大部分城市多四倍的费用来运营在硅谷的公司。新科技公司，从量子计算到合成生物学，提供比互联网服务更低的利润率，让这些新兴领域的初创公司更注重节约现金。所有这一切都考虑到旧金山湾区生活的糟糕之处以外：交通堵塞、废弃的针管以及触目惊心的不平等。

Other cities are rising in relative importance as a result. The Kauffman Foundation, a non-profit group that tracks entrepreneurship, now ranks the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area first for startup activity in America, based on the density of startups and new entrepreneurs. Mr Thiel is moving to Los Angeles, which has a vibrant tech scene. Phoenix and Pittsburgh have become hubs for autonomous vehicles; New York for media startups; London for fintech; Shenzhen for hardware. None of these places can match the Valley on its own; between them, they point to a world in which innovation is more distributed.

其它城市的重要性也在上升。考夫曼基金会，是一个追踪创业公司的非盈利机构组织，基于新创公司以及新创业者的密度，现在在迈阿-劳德尔代堡地区的新创公司活动中排名 第一。泰尔先生搬到了洛杉机，在那里有活跃的科技项目。凤凰城和匹兹堡已经成为自动驾驶汽车的中心；纽约则是媒体新创公司的基地；伦敦则是金融科技城；深圳是硬件之都。它们之中没有一个地方是能够和硅谷媲美的；在它们之中可以看到，创新在全球更具分散性。

If great ideas can bubble up in more places, that has to be welcome. There are some reasons to think the playing-field for innovation is indeed being levelled up. Capital is becoming more widely available to bright sparks everywhere: tech investors increasingly trawl the world, not just California, for hot ideas. There is less reason than ever for a single region to be the epicentre of technology. Thanks to the tools that the Valley’s own firms have produced, from smartphones to video calls to messaging apps, teams can work effectively from different offices and places. A more even distribution of wealth may be one result, greater diversity of thought another. The Valley does many things remarkably well, but it comes dangerously close to being a monoculture of white male nerds. Companies founded by women received just 2% of the funding doled out by venture capitalists last year.

假如好的想法能在更多地方涌现出来，那应该不错。有一些观点认为创新的竞技场正在升级。资金正在为全球其它地方提供更广泛的资助，不仅仅在加州，不仅仅为热门的创意点子。一个地区已经不太成为全球的技术中心了。感谢那些硅谷的公司发明的工具，从智能手机到视频通话到即时通App,团队们能够从不同的办公室和位置进行高效的工作。财富更均衡分布也许是一个结果，思维的多样化也许是另一个结果。硅谷很多事情都做得很好，但是却危险地与白人男子技术狂的单一性相靠近。去年，女性创始人的公司只获得2%的风险投资。

Shadows of the colossi

巨人的影子

The problem is that the wider playing-field for innovation is also being levelled down. One issue is the dominance of the tech giants. Startups, particularly those in the consumer-internet business, increasingly struggle to attract capital in the shadow of Alphabet, Apple, Facebook et al. In 2017 the number of first financing rounds in America was down by around 22% from 2012. Alphabet and Facebook pay their employees so generously that startups can struggle to attract talent (the median salary at Facebook is $240,000). When the chances of startup success are even less certain and the payoffs not so very different from a steady job at one of the giants, dynamism suffers—and not just in the Valley. It is a similar story in China, where Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent are responsible for close to half of all domestic venture-capital investment, giving the giants a big say in the future of potential rivals.

问题是广泛的创新竞技场的级别也在下降。一个原因是技术巨头的优势。新创公司，尤其是那些在消费类业务中的新创公司，越来越难以吸引到像Alphabet、苹果、脸书以及其它公司的资金。在2017年美国第一轮融资数量与2012年相比下降了22%。Alphabet和脸书向员工慷慨地支付薪酬，以至新创公司难以吸引到人材（脸书的收入中位数达到24万美元）。当初创公司成机的机会还不太确定的时候，在互联网巨头得到稳定工作的回报与之并没有太多区别，创造力就会受到伤害——情况并不单单在硅谷发生。相同的故事发生在中国，阿里巴巴、百度和腾讯包揽了国内接近一半的风险投资，让这些巨头在未来的竞争对手中掌握了很大的发言权。

The second way in which innovation is being levelled down is by increasingly unfriendly policies in the West. Rising anti-immigrant sentiment and tighter visa regimes of the sort introduced by President Donald Trump have economy-wide effects: foreign entrepreneurs create around 25% of new companies in America. Silicon Valley first bloomed, in large part, because of government largesse. But state spending on public universities throughout America and Europe has fallen since the financial crisis of 2007-08. Funding for basic research is inadequate—America’s federal-government spending on R&amp;D was 0.6% of GDP in 2015, a third of what it was in 1964—and heading in the wrong direction.

第二个创新能力下降的原因是在西方日益不友善的政治氛围。反移民情绪的抬头以及由特朗普总统出台的更严格的签证制度对经济产生了影响：在美国，外国企业创立了约25%的新公司。硅谷的首次发展，很大程度上，是因为政府的慷慨。但是美国和欧洲从2007-2008年金融危机后，在公立大学上的开支已经在下降。基础学科研究经费不足——2015年，美国联邦政府在研究与开发项目中的开支仅占GDP的0.6%，只是1964年三分之一——并且在错误的方向上行走 。

If Silicon Valley’s relative decline heralded the rise of a global web of thriving, rival tech hubs, that would be worth celebrating. Unfortunately, the Valley’s peak looks more like a warning that innovation everywhere is becoming harder.

假如硅谷的衰落预示了全球蓬勃发展的网络的兴起的话，竞争对手的技术中心值得庆贺。不幸的是，硅谷的成功貌似更像一个警告，各地的创新都变得越来越难。
