Hacking gets physical

Target, Yahoo, Equifax: the list of prominent victims of cyber-attacks is already long, and will surely lengthen further in 2018. But in the year ahead sec¬urity types will also be worried about the next, potentially even scarier generation of hacking. It could cause physical, not just financial, harm.

塔吉特、雅虎、艾奎法克斯：受网络袭击的主要受害者的名单还很长，在2018年这份名单还会进一步增加。但在未来的一年里，安全类型也会成为下一个令人担忧的问题，甚至有可能是更可怕的黑客袭击。它不仅造成经济损失，还能带来物理损失。

In industrialised countries critical national infrastructure, including hospitals, railways and even nuclear defence systems, cannot be hacked only through its connection to a network. It also relies on a constant stream of data to operate efficiently. Weather stations, airports, motorways and power plants react to incoming information on a minute-by-minute, even second-by-second, basis. But what if such data could be faked by saboteurs?

在工业国家，国家基础建设到至关重要，包括医院、铁路以及甚至是核防御系统，仅通过与之相连的网络进行袭击。这也依赖于恒定的数据流进行有效运作。基本上，气象台、机场、高速公路以及发电厂对每分钟，甚至每秒钟对接收的信息都要作出反应。但是假如这些数据都被破坏者伪装了呢？

In June 2017 the master of a ship near the Russian port of Novorossiysk, 80km (50 miles) east of Crimea, suddenly realised that his GPS was giving him the wrong information: his vessel was floating on water and was not 32km inland. The same problem was affecting at least 20 other ships in the area. “There’s incontrovertible evidence that spoofing occurred,” says Todd Humphreys, of the University of Texas at Austin.

在2017年6月，在靠近俄罗斯港口的诺沃西比尔斯克，克里米亚半岛以东80公里（50英里）的一艘船的船主，突然发现他的GPS出现错误信息：他的船在海上漂浮，离内陆不到32公里。相同的问题在该区域也影响了至少20艘船只。

Mr Humphreys believes transport networks are particularly vulnerable. He also worries about the New York Stock Exchange. Traders use a signal from an atomic clock, operated by the National Physical Laboratory, which he says could be spoofed.

汉弗莱先生相信，运输网络特别脆弱。他也对纽约证券交易所感到担忧。交易者用国家物理实验室操作的原子钟发出的信号进行交易，他说信号有可能被伪造。


The purpose of attacks on critical infrastructure in the near future would probably be to undermine trust, embarrass enemies and test hacking capabilities, rather than cause physical harm. But Beyza Unal, a research fellow at Chatham House, a foreign-policy think-tank, is concerned that nuclear weapons are vulnerable, because they rely on real-time information exchange. Information comes in from a variety of sources, so instead of hacking into servers, a saboteur could create his own data and send them to the computers which inform nuclear launch systems. Ms Unal says she is not confident that the world’s nuclear arsenals are secure.

在不久的将来，针对主要基础设施攻击的目的可能是破坏信任，让对手难堪以及测试黑客攻击能力，而不是引起物理损失。但是查塔姆研究所——一个外交政策智库——的研究员贝萨乌纳尔担心核武器系统是脆弱易受攻击的——因为它们依赖实时信息交换。信息有各种各样的来源，破坏者可以建立其数据以及发送这些数据到核发射系统的电脑上，用以代替入侵数据库。乌纳尔女士对全球核武库的安全失去信心。

There are no internationally acknowledged security requirements to protect nuclear weapons systems from digital assaults. That may have to change in 2018.

目前并没有一个国际公认的安全需求保护核武器系统不受数字攻击。这种情况在2018年可能不得不发生改变。
