Futures in New York traded down 1.2 percent from the close Friday. There was no settlement Monday because of the U.S. Memorial Day holiday and all trades will be booked Tuesday. Saudi Arabia and Russia last week signaled they may restore some of the output halted as part of a deal between OPEC and its allies, amid growing supply concerns.

Crude earlier this month rose to the highest level in more than three years after U.S. President Donald Trump decided to reimpose sanctions on Iran and as Venezuelan output continues to fall amid an economic and political crisis. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is maintaining its bullish view, saying an output increase from Russia and Saudi Arabia would only offset involuntary production declines.
