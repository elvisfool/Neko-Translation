Asian stocks struggled for traction Monday with energy shares tumbling after oil extended its biggest drop in about a year. The euro rallied after Italy’s president rejected a candidate for finance minister who’s been skeptical of the single currency.

原油在一年内出现最大跌幅后，香港周一股市受能源股暴跌影响疲软。欧元在意大利总统拒绝财政部长作为候选人后上涨，该财政部长对单一货币持怀疑态度。
 
Benchmarks dipped in Tokyo, Shanghai and Australia. South Korean stocks rose, as did U.S. futures, after President Donald Trump appeared to confirm that his June summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un was back on. Hong Kong stocks were little changed. The MSCI Asia Pacific Energy Index had the biggest decline after a Saudi minister said petroleum supply would likely rise in the second half. Oil slid further below $70 a barrel in New York while the dollar slipped against most major peers.

东京，上海和澳洲的基准指标下跌。在美国总统特朗普似乎证实与北韩领袖金正恩恢复6月的峰会后，和南韩股市一样，美国股指期货也在上涨。香港股市基本持平。在沙特部长表示，石油供应在下半年有望提高后，摩根斯丹利亚太能源指数出现最大跌幅。在纽约，当美元对主要同业下跌时，油价进一步下跌至每桶70美元。
 
Trading may be subdued round the world by U.S. and U.K. holidays Monday.

Investors turn their attention to the economy this week with readings on European inflation, Chinese manufacturing and Friday’s U.S. jobs report, the last before Federal Reserve policy makers meet in June. Italian assets will be in focus after that country sank deeper into political uncertainty, with populist leaders failing in their attempt to form a government.

投资者本周把注意力转向经济领域，随着经济学家们对欧洲通胀，中国制造业以及美国周五就业报告做出分析，美联储在6月制定新的货币政策前，发布最后一份就业报告(美国非农业人口就业报告)。意大利深陷国家政治不确定性中，随着民粹主义领导人重组政府失败后，该国人民对资产持谨慎态度。

“We may now be in for an extended period of heightened uncertainty ahead of fresh elections - assuming that’s where we’re headed - but that’s not a story for today,” said Ray Attrill, head of foreign-exchange strategy at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Sydney, referring to the euro’s advance on Monday. “For now it’s more relief that Italy will not - for now at least - have an avowed euro-skeptic finance minister.”
"我们在新一轮选举前会也许会面临更多的不确定性-假设我们选举领先的话-但这不是今天发生的事情"，澳大利亚国民银行有限公司外汇策略主管，Ray Attrill表示。在悉尼，周一欧元上涨。"目前令人安慰的是意大利不会-至少目前不会-公开肯定对欧盟持怀疑论的财政部长"。
