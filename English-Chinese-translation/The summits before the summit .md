What to expect from talks with North Korea
对与北韩的会谈有何期待

Not as much as America’s and South Korea’s leaders do
没有美国和南韩领导人做的那般多

SUDDENLY, everybody wants to talk to the hermit king. On April 17th the Washington Post reported that Mike Pompeo, the director of the CIA, met North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un, over the Easter weekend. President Donald Trump more or less confirmed the story during a meeting with Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe: “We have had direct talks at very high levels, extremely high levels, with North Korea.”

不知从何时起，所有人都想与这位隐世国王会谈。四月十七日，《华盛顿邮报》报导了迈克·蓬佩奥——美国中情局局长——在复活节周末，与北韩领导人金正恩的会面。特朗普总统在与日本首相安倍晋三会面时或多或少地证实了这条新闻：“我们与北韩进行了高级别的会谈，非常高的级别。”

Mr Trump further indicated that his summit with Mr Kim was likely to take place by early June. In the meantime, he said, he had given his “blessing” to talks about formally ending the Korean war (the shooting stopped in 1953) at a summit on April 27th between Mr Kim and Moon Jae-in, South Korea’s president. On April 18th a senior South Korean official confirmed that talks about a permanent peace agreement and a possible security guarantee for North Korea were on the table for the inter-Korean summit, along with a joint statement about “denuclearisation”—a polite term for scrapping North Korea’s nuclear arsenal.

特朗普总统进一步指出与金正恩的会面很有可能会在六月初。同时，他补充，在四月二十七日金正恩与南朝总统文在寅举行的峰会上，对正式结束的朝鲜战争（战争在1953年结束）给予了“祝福”。在四月十八日一名南韩的高级官员证实，关于永久和平协议的谈判以及朝韩首脑会唔对于北韩在谈判桌上有可能签署的安全保障协议，还有一份关于“无核化”的联合声明——这是对于北韩弃核的委婉说法。

Suddenly, not only did the two summits, which many had suspected would never take place, seem on track; there was also a prospect of real discussions. The term jongjun, which translates roughly as “end of war”, began trending on Naver, South Korea’s biggest search engine. On social media, people rushed to thank Mr Moon, the “best president ever”. The price of “reunification stocks”, such as railways and construction companies, shot up. Meanwhile elderly conservatives staged protests on Seoul’s subway against what they see as a sell-out to the communists.

一时之间，不仅是两场峰会——很多人还怀疑这一切不会发生——正在步入正轨中；也有可能真的会谈判。“jongjun”这个词的意思大概是”结束战争“，最初在南韩最大的搜索引擎Naver中开始流行。在社交媒体上，网民们点赞文寅总统“最好的总统”。比如铁路和建设公司这样的“统一股票”的价格暴涨。同时，老保守派在首尔的地铁上进行示威，反对他们认为的对共产党背叛的行为。

“If the summit is a success we can have the place up and running again in a month,” says Woo Gye-keun of South Korea’s unification ministry. He is referring to the inter-Korean transit office near Ganseong, through which hundreds of thousands of South Koreans passed at the height of a past period of detente, to enjoy cultural exchanges, family reunions and hikes in the mountain park just across the border in the North. The subsequent cooling of relations left Mr Woo and his staff with nothing to do but scrub floors and dust countertops in the giant steel-and-glass building, in the hope that the tourists would eventually return.

韩国统一部的吴业昆（注：音译）声称，“假如峰会成功的话，我们会一个月内重启这个地方。”他指的是靠近甘松附近的南北韩运输办公室，在过去关系缓和时期，有成千上万的人韩国人经过那里，参与文化交流，家庭团聚以及只要踏过北韩，就能在山上的公园远足。后来两韩关系的僵化，让吴先生和他的员工无事可做，除了在巨大的玻璃钢大楼里搞卫生，他们还是希望游客们最终能回来。

Cold showers needed
各方都需要冷静一下

Alas, both summits are likely to disappoint, but in different ways. The South-North talks will probably skirt hard topics such as human rights. Moreover, restarting even cross-border tourism, let alone heftier trade or investment, is impossible given the dense thicket of international sanctions around the North. Instead, Korea-watchers expect a focus on simpler goals such as agreeing to regular future meetings.

两场峰会也可能令人失望，但是以不同的方式。南北韩谈判将很可能绕过一些诸如人权这类话题。此外，甚至重开跨境旅游，更不必说贸易和投资了，对于经历多次国际制裁的北韩来说几乎是不可能的。相反，朝鲜观察家期待一些诸如同意在未来举行定期会晤的简单目标。

The subsequent summit between America and North Korea threatens almost the opposite outcome. Mr Trump and Mr Kim both talk about denuclearisation, and appear to have high expectations. But they see the forthcoming meeting through entirely different lenses.

在随后而来的美朝峰会几乎产生了相反的结果。特朗普与金正恩双方会谈及无核化以及两人对会谈有很高的期望。但是他们通过完全不同的视角来看待即将来临的会晤。

Mr Trump seems to believe that a combination of tougher sanctions and military threats has brought Mr Kim to the negotiating table. Once there, Mr Trump suggests, he should present a plan for complete, verifiable and irreversible nuclear disarmament. In the meantime America’s “maximum pressure” on North Korea, including the possibility of pre-emptive military action, would not be relaxed. After North Korea begins dismantling its nuclear programme, anything might be possible.

特朗普似乎相信严厉的制裁和军事威胁的双作用把金正恩带由谈判桌上。特朗普建议，一旦出现这种情况，他应该提出一项完整的，可核查的以及不可逆转的核裁军计划。在此期间，美国对北韩的“最大压力”包括先发制人的军事行动的可能性，这些都不会松懈。在北韩废除其核计划外，一切皆有可能。


Mr Kim, in all likelihood, has something very different in mind. Whenever North Korea has talked in the past about “denuclearisation of the whole Korean peninsula”, it has made it clear that any reductions of its own nuclear arsenal would depend on the departure of American forces from South Korea and the removal of the “nuclear umbrella” that America extends to both South Korea and Japan.
 
金正恩多半有别的想法。每当朝鲜在过去谈论“朝鲜半岛无核化”时，它都明确表明任何核武库的削减都处决于美军从南韩的撤军以及美国拆除延伸到南韩和日本的“核保护伞”。

Mr Kim would undoubtedly like to get some relief from sanctions and lock America into a drawn-out process of “phased, synchronised measures to achieve peace”. He probably thinks that Mr Trump is prepared to talk to him directly only because North Korea is on the verge of wielding nuclear missiles that could hit the American mainland. (No sitting American president ever met Mr Kim’s father or grandfather, from whom he inherited the job of dictator.) The summit is thus a recognition by America of his country’s status as a nuclear power. Jonathan Pollack of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank, regards it as “magical thinking” to suppose that Mr Kim has any intention of giving up his nukes.

金正恩无疑希望从制裁中得到解脱以及使美国受困于“采取分阶段的，同步措施实现和平”这样的漫长过程。他可能认为特朗普准备与他直接会晤仅仅因为北韩的的核导弹能击中美国本土（没有哪位在任美国总统见过金正恩的父亲或者祖父，自从他继承了独裁政权以来）。这次的峰会是美国对其是一个核大国的认可。乔纳森·波拉克是布鲁斯金协会智囊团的成员，认为那假设金正恩会放弃核武这是“一厢情愿”的想法。

That does not mean that Mr Kim will come to the summit empty-handed. Mr Pompeo must have been given enough encouragement to think it worth the president’s while to turn up. Mr Kim’s aim may be to offer a concession big enough to entice Mr Trump into the kind of protracted negotiation that would suit the North Korean despot nicely. One possibility might be a moratorium on tests of nuclear devices and of missiles with enough range to hit America. Mr Kim could hold out the prospect of never deploying such weapons in return for the lifting of some sanctions and progress towards the peace treaty that he hopes might eventually lead to the departure of American troops.

这并不意味着金正恩会空手而归。蓬佩奥一定有足够的信心认为总统值得出席峰会。金正恩的目的也许会提供足够多的让步使得特朗普陷入旷日持久的迎合北韩独裁者的谈判中。一种可能认为暂停其射程可以打击美国的核装置以及导弹测试。金正恩可能会坚持不再部署武器，以解除制裁以及他希望和平条约的进展最终令美军撤离作为回报。

For his part, Mr Trump could boast of honouring his commitment to remove the threat to America of North Korean missiles, albeit at the cost of potentially weakening the alliance with South Korea and Japan. North Korea and its protector, China, have long wanted to decouple America from its regional allies.

对于特朗普而言，他可以夸耀自己承诺解除北韩导弹对美国的威胁， 尽管代价是可能会消弱南韩和日本的同盟关系。北韩和其保护人，中国，一直希望美国能减弱与其区域同盟的关系。

Might Mr Trump accept such a dismal offer? It would be reassuring to think that the hawkish Mr Pompeo would counsel against it. But Mr Trump likes Mr Pompeo, his nominee as the next secretary of state, largely because he skilfully panders to the moods and instincts of his boss. It would also be characteristic of Mr Trump to play for the headlines and leave others to confront the thorny details. Gary Samore, a former adviser to Barack Obama, thinks that even if the talks go nowhere it is better to talk than to prepare for war. But like Mr Pollack, he has low expectations. As another Obama administration official ruefully observed, talking to the Kim family is like going to Taco Bell. You might go looking for something new, but you always end up with the same thing.

特朗普会接受这样一个令人沮丧的提议吗？令人安慰的是鹰派蓬佩奥一定会持反对意见。但是特朗普将他视为下一届国务卿的提名人，因为很大程度上他巧妙地迎合了特朗普的情绪和本能。特朗普成为头条新闻以及让他人面对棘手的细节这已经是他上台以来的一种特色。盖里·莫尔萨是奥巴马的前顾问，认为即使谈判无果，也比要为战争做准备要好。但像波拉克，却对峰会却有较低的期望。作为奥巴马政府另一位政府官员遗憾地说，与金氏家庭会晤就好比去塔可钟，你可能会寻找一些新的东西，但最后结果还是一样。
