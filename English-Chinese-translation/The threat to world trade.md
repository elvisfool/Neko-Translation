基于规则的系统正处于高度危险之中

Donald Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminium would be just the start

唐纳特朗普关于钢铁和铝的关税法令只是一个开始

Mar 8th 2018

DONALD TRUMP is hardly the first American president to slap unilateral tariffs on imports. Every inhabitant of the Oval Office since Jimmy Carter has imposed some kind of protectionist curbs on trade, often on steel. Nor will Mr Trump’s vow to put 25% tariffs on steel and 10% on aluminium by themselves wreck the economy: they account for 2% of last year’s $2.4trn of goods imports, or 0.2% of GDP. If this were the extent of Mr Trump’s protectionism, it would simply be an act of senseless self-harm. In fact, it is a potential disaster—both for America and for the world economy.


唐纳特朗普可以说是美国第一任对进口产品征收单边关税的总统。自吉米卡特执政以后，椭圆形办公室的每个掌门人都对贸易——通常是钢铁——采取了某些贸易主义措施。特朗普也不会承诺对钢铁征收25%和对铝征收10%的关税本身会破坏经济：它们占去年2.4万亿进口货物的2%，或者国民生产总值的2%。如果这是特朗普贸易保护主义的范围的话，这也许是毫无意义的自残行为。事实上，这是一种潜在的灾难——无论对美国还是对世界经济而言。

As yet it is unclear exactly what Mr Trump will do (see Briefing). But the omens are bad. Unlike his predecessors, Mr Trump is a long-standing sceptic of free trade. He has sneered at the multilateral trading system, which he sees as a bad deal for America. His administration is chaotic, and Gary Cohn’s ominous decision on March 6th to resign as the president’s chief economic adviser deprives the White House of a rare free-trader, signalling that it has fallen into protectionist hands. Not since its inception at the end of the second world war has the global trading system faced such danger.

目前尚不清楚特朗普会采取什么措施。但不是什么好的预兆。不像他的前任，特朗普是一位对自由贸易的长期怀疑者。他曾对多边贸易对美国而言是笔糟糕交易的体制嗤之以鼻。他的领导班子混乱不堪，盖里·科恩，作为总统的首席经济顾问，在三月六日宣布辞职的不祥决定令白宫失去了一位自由贸易者，这是一个回到贸易保护主义的信号。自二战结束以来，全球贸易体系从未面临过这样的危险。

Rough trade 粗放贸易

This danger has several dimensions. One is the risk of tit-for-tat escalation. After the EU said it would retaliate with sanctions on American goods, including bourbon and Harley-Davidson motorbikes, Mr Trump threatened exports of European cars.

这种危险有几种程度。其中一方面就是越发针锋相对的风险。在欧盟声称要对美国商品——包括波旁威士忌酒和哈雷戴维森的机车——进行报复性制裁后，特朗普威胁欧洲汽车对美国的出口。

The second danger springs from Mr Trump’s rationale. The tariffs are based on a little-used law that lets a president protect industry on grounds of national security. That excuse is self-evidently spurious. Most of America’s imports of steel come from Canada, the European Union, Mexico and South Korea, America’s allies. Canada and Mexico look set to be temporarily excluded—but only because Mr Trump wants leverage in his renegotiation of the North American Free-Trade Agreement, which has nothing to do with national security. Mr Trump is setting a precedent that other countries are sure to exploit to protect their own producers, just as spuriously.

第二个危险来源于特朗普的理由。关税是基于一项很少使用的法律之上，这项法律使得总统以国家安全为由去保护工业。这是个不言而喻伪造的借口。大部分美国进口的钢材来自于加拿大，欧盟，墨西哥和南韩这些美国盟友国家。加拿大和墨西哥似乎能排除在外，但仅仅是因为特朗普希望在与北美自由贸易协定的重新谈判中发挥影响力，协定与国家安全无关。特朗普开启了一个先例，其它国家肯定会利用这个机会不合逻辑地保护其生产者。

It is not clear whether other countries can respond legally when national security is invoked in this way. This puts the World Trade Organisation (WTO) into a rat trap. Either Mr Trump will provoke a free-for-all of recrimination and retaliation that the WTO’s courts cannot adjudicate, or the courts will second-guess America’s national-security needs, in which case Mr Trump may storm out of the organisation altogether.

当以这种方法调用国家安全时，还不清楚其它国家是否能依法作出回应。这会让当世贸组织陷入到一种无望的局面中。要么特朗普将引发一场世贸组织不能作出裁决的互相指责和报复的混战中，要么法院会对美国的国家安全需求进行事后预测，在这种情况下，特朗普也许会彻底退出该组织。

The WTO is already under strain. The collapse of the Doha round of trade talks in 2015, after 14 fruitless years, put needed reforms on hold indefinitely. Disputes that might have been swept into a new trade round have fallen to the WTO’s dispute-resolution machinery, which is too slow and too frail to carry the burden.The WTO has not kept pace with economic change. Investment is increasingly tied up in intangibles, such as patents and copyright, rather than physical assets, such as steel mills. Rules drafted for rich, market-led economies cannot always police state capitalism. The implicit subsidies China gives its producers were a cause of global gluts in industrial metals. No wonder that the world’s second-biggest economy has been the focus of so much anger.

世贸组织已处在压力当中。在2015年多哈回合贸易的谈判在14年没有结果的情况下破裂，使改革的需求无限期搁置起来。可能被卷入新一轮贸易谈判的争端已经落入世贸组织的争议解决机制中，该机制效率的缓慢和脆弱已不能承担这些重担。世贸组织并没有与经济发展同步。投资正日益被无形资产所束缚，比如专利和版权，而不是实物资产，比如钢铁企业，为富人起草的规则，以市场为导向的经济体不可能监督国家资本主义。中国给予其生产者隐性补贴是导致全球工业金属出现过剩的原因之一。难怪世界第二大经济体成为各方愤怒的焦点。

Whatever the WTO’s problems, it would be a tragedy to undermine it. If America pursues a mercantilist trade policy in defiance of the global trading system, other countries are bound to follow. That might not lead to an immediate collapse of the WTO, but it would gradually erode one of the foundations of the globalised economy.

不管世贸组织有什么问题，破坏它将是一场悲剧。假如美国奉行重商主义贸易政策不顾全球交易系统，其它国家一定会仿效。这可能不会导致世贸组织的崩溃，但是它将会逐渐削弱全球经济的一个基础。

Everyone would suffer. Mr Trump seems to think trade is a zero-sum affair, in which a deficit is a sign of a bad deal. But the vast improvement in living standards after the second world war went hand in hand with a rapid expansion in world trade over eight trade rounds, each of which lowered barriers. Imports are in fact welcome, because they benefit consumers and spur producers to specialise in what they do best.

每个人都会受到影响。特朗普似乎认为贸易是零和博弈的事情，在这种情况下，赤字是一个糟糕交易的信号。但是二战后生活水平的巨大提高与世界贸易通过八轮谈判的快速扩张密切相关，每一次的谈判都降低贸易壁垒。事实上，进口很受欢迎，因为会惠及消费者以及刺激生产商专注于他们擅长的领域。
Without the WTO, cross-border trade would continue—it is unstoppable—but the lack of norms and procedures would leave disputes to escalate. The fewer the rules, the more scope for mercantilist mischief and backsliding. Trade policy could be captured by special interests. Military power would hold greater sway in trade disputes than economic fair play. Transnational investment could drain away. As a vast continental economy, America would lose less from this than other countries. It would nonetheless lose a lot, including a pillar of the system that has underpinned its post-war political influence.

没有世贸组织，跨境贸易依然存在——这是不可阻挡的——但是规范和程序的缺失将会使得争议升级。规则越少，重商主义破坏和倒退的空间就越大。 在贸易争端中，军事力量将比经济公平竞争更具影响力。作为一个巨大的大陆经济体，美国将比其它国家损失更少。尽管如此，它还是会损失很多，包括支撑其战后政治影响力的体系支柱。

How should the world get out of this bind? Even as Mr Trump behaves with astonishing irresponsibility, others must keep their heads. Some may impose limited retaliation—that, after all, is how to treat bullies, and the threat to local manufactures will strengthen the hand of Republicans pressing Mr Trump to relent. But such action must be proportionate and limited. A tit-for-tat war with America would be disastrous.

世界将如何摆脱这种束缚？正如特朗普表现出令人侧目的不负责任，其他人必须保持清醒。一些国家可能会实施有限的报复，毕竟，这是如何面对霸凌以及，对当地制造业的威胁将加强共和党人迫使特朗普态度软化。但是这样的行动必须是适度和有限的。与美国针锋相对的贸易战将会是一场灾难。

Back to basics 回复本源

The more important task is to shore up support for trade. It would be comforting to think there is global backing to fix the WTO. But just now, there is not. The only new trade deals on offer are regional, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), an 11-country pact signed this week that sets out to be a blueprint for trade modernisation. Although Mr Trump abandoned it, he has hinted he may reconsider, which would be a start.


更重要的任务是加强对贸易的支持。用全球各国的支持来解决世贸组织的问题将会是一个令人欣慰的想法。但就目前而言，情况并非如此。唯一存在的新贸易法则是地区性的，比如跨太平洋伙伴关系协定（TTP），以及本周由十一个国家签署的世界贸易现代化蓝图。尽管特朗普放弃了这一协定，但他暗示会重新考虑。那将是明智的选择。

The best way to help the WTO would be for its other members to co-ordinate any action, including bringing in a WTO complaint about Mr Trump’s tariffs. Even though that may burden the WTO’s court, it would be a vote of confidence in the idea that the global economy should be governed by rules.

帮助世贸组织最好的办法是让其成员国协调任何行动，包括引入世贸组织对特朗普关税法令的申诉。尽管这可能会加重世贸组织法院的负担，这将是全球经济应受规则约束的想法的信心投票。

The world is a long way from the 1930s, thank goodness. Yet ignorance and complacency have put the trading system in grave danger. Free-traders need to recognise that the WTO can help keep markets open in the face of protectionist lobbying, at home and abroad. It is vital they make the intellectual case for rules-based trade. That will not be easy. For the first time in decades, their biggest foe is the man in the Oval Office.

幸亏，距离上世纪三十年代已经很久远了。我们的无知和自满把贸易体系置于极度危险之中。自由贸易者需要承认的是，在贸易保护主义的游说下，世贸组织可以保护市场保持开放，无论是国内还是国外。至关重要的是，它为了基于规则的贸易提供了知识产权。这并不容易，这是过去几十年来的第一次，它们最大的敌人是坐在椭圆形办公室的人。
