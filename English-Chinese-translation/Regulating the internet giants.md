A NEW commodity spawns a lucrative, fast-growing industry, prompting antitrust regulators to step in to restrain those who control its flow. A century ago, the resource in question was oil. Now similar concerns are being raised by the giants that deal in data, the oil of the digital era. These titans—Alphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft—look unstoppable. They are the five most valuable listed firms in the world. Their profits are surging: they collectively racked up over $25bn in net profit in the first quarter of 2017. Amazon captures half of all dollars spent online in America. Google and Facebook accounted for almost all the revenue growth in digital advertising in America last year. 

一种新的商品产生了一个利润丰厚的，快速增长的工业，促使反垄断机构介入，去限制那些控制其业务流动的人。一个世纪之前，讨论的资源是石油。现在数据交易的巨头们引起了类似的担忧，数字时代的石油。这些巨头公司——阿尔法贝塔公司（谷歌的母公司），亚马逊，苹果，脸书以及微软）——看上去势不可挡。他们是世界上最有价值的五家上市公司。他们的利润在增长: 他们在2017年第一季度的净利润总计就超过了250亿美元。亚马逊占据了美国一半的线上交易额。谷歌和脸书几乎占据了美国去年数字广告的全部增长。

Such dominance has prompted calls for the tech giants to be broken up, as Standard Oil was in the early 20th century. This newspaper has argued against such drastic action in the past. Size alone is not a crime. The giants’ success has benefited consumers. Few want to live without Google’s search engine, Amazon’s one-day delivery or Facebook’s newsfeed. Nor do these firms raise the alarm when standard antitrust tests are applied. Far from gouging consumers, many of their services are free (users pay, in effect, by handing over yet more data). Take account of offline rivals, and their market shares look less worrying. And the emergence of upstarts like Snapchat suggests that new entrants can still make waves.

这种优势促使人们呼吁将技术巨头公司进行拆分，正如美孚石油公司在上世纪早期那样。本刊曾反对在过去进行如此激烈的行为。公司规模本身并不是犯罪。巨头公司的成功使得消费者受惠。只有少部分人能够在没有谷歌的搜索引擎，亚马逊的一天到达送货以及脸书的新闻输送下生活。当采用标准反托拉斯法测试时，也没有对这些巨头们敲响警钟。他们的许多服务是免费的，而不是欺诈消费者（实际上用户通过支付交出他们数据）。考虑到线下的竞争对手，他们的市场份额似乎不那么糟糕。像Snapchat这样的互联网新贵的崛起，表明新的市场进入者也能呼风唤雨。


But there is cause for concern. Internet companies’ control of data gives them enormous power. Old ways of thinking about competition, devised in the era of oil, look outdated in what has come to be called the “data economy” (see Briefing). A new approach is needed.

但也有令人担忧的理由。互联网公司对数据的控制给了他们巨大的权力。在石油的年代，旧的思维方式是竞争，在称之为“数据经济”的时代已经过时了。在这个时代，需要一种新的方式。


Quantity has a quality all its own
数量有其自身的特点

What has changed? Smartphones and the internet have made data abundant, ubiquitous and far more valuable. Whether you are going for a run, watching TV or even just sitting in traffic, virtually every activity creates a digital trace—more raw material for the data distilleries. As devices from watches to cars connect to the internet, the volume is increasing: some estimate that a self-driving car will generate 100 gigabytes per second. Meanwhile, artificial-intelligence (AI) techniques such as machine learning extract more value from data. Algorithms can predict when a customer is ready to buy, a jet-engine needs servicing or a person is at risk of a disease. Industrial giants such as GE and Siemens now sell themselves as data firms.

是什么改变了吗？智能手机和互联网使得数据变得丰富，无所不在以及更有价值。无论你去跑步，看电视还是在车流中，每一个活动无形中都建立了一个数据痕迹——为数据中心提供更多的原始信息。从手表到汽车这样设备连到互联网，数据容量开始增加——有人估计，无人驾驶汽车每秒钟将会产生100G的数据。与此同时，AI(人工智能)，诸如：机器学习，将会从数据中获取更多价值。算法能够预测，客户何时进行购买，喷气式飞机何时需要检修以及一个人患病的风险。工业巨头，如通用公司和西门子以数据公司来标榜自己。


This abundance of data changes the nature of competition. Technology giants have always benefited from network effects: the more users Facebook signs up, the more attractive signing up becomes for others. With data there are extra network effects. By collecting more data, a firm has more scope to improve its products, which attracts more users, generating even more data, and so on. The more data Tesla gathers from its self-driving cars, the better it can make them at driving themselves—part of the reason the firm, which sold only 25,000 cars in the first quarter, is now worth more than GM, which sold 2.3m. Vast pools of data can thus act as protective moats.

这些大量的数据改变了竞争的本质。科技巨头们一直从网络效应中获益：越多的用户在脸书上注册，对其他人来说注册的吸引力就越大。有了数据，就会有额外的网络效应。通过搜集数据，一家公司有更多的空间去改善其产品，吸引更多的客户，生成更多的数据，等等。特斯拉在无人驾驶汽车中搜集越多的数据，这使得公司更好地驾驭自己——这也是他们在第一季度卖出两万五千辆汽车的部分原因，现在他们的估值超过了卖出两百三十万辆汽车的通用公司。海量的数据能够起到护城河一样的作用。
 
Access to data also protects companies from rivals in another way. The case for being sanguine about competition in the tech industry rests on the potential for incumbents to be blindsided by a startup in a garage or an unexpected technological shift. But both are less likely in the data age. The giants’ surveillance systems span the entire economy: Google can see what people search for, Facebook what they share, Amazon what they buy. They own app stores and operating systems, and rent out computing power to startups. They have a “God’s eye view” of activities in their own markets and beyond. They can see when a new product or service gains traction, allowing them to copy it or simply buy the upstart before it becomes too great a threat. Many think Facebook’s $22bn purchase in 2014 of WhatsApp, a messaging app with fewer than 60 employees, falls into this category of “shoot-out acquisitions” that eliminate potential rivals. By providing barriers to entry and early-warning systems, data can stifle competition.

获取数据也能以另一种方式保护公司免受竞争者打击。对于科技行业竞争持乐观态度的理由是，无论是在车库的初创者还是在令人意外的技术转变中，公司的现任者都可能被打得措手不及。但在数据时代，两者都不可能。巨头们的监视系统跨越了整个经济：谷歌知道人们在搜索什么，脸书知道人们在分享什么，亚马逊知道人们在购买什么。他们拥有自家的应用商店和操作系统，将计算能力出租给初创公司。他们对自己的市场和更远的领域对用户行为有着“上帝般视野”，他们能够看到当一个新产品或者服务有吸引力的时候——巨头们在它们变成巨大的威胁前——复制它们或者干脆买下它们。许多人认为脸书在2014年斥资220亿美元买下Whatsapp——一家员工少于六十人的即时通程序公司——属于消除竞争对手的“枪战式收购”。通过提供入口和预警系统碍，数据也能扼杀竞争。

Who ya gonna call, trustbusters?
你会致电给谁？反托拉斯者吗？

The nature of data makes the antitrust remedies of the past less useful. Breaking up a firm like Google into five Googlets would not stop network effects from reasserting themselves: in time, one of them would become dominant again. A radical rethink is required—and as the outlines of a new approach start to become apparent, two ideas stand out.

数据的本质使得过去的反托拉斯救济变得不那么有用了。把谷歌这样的公司拆分为五个谷歌公司并不会阻止网络效应自身的重新确立：随着时间的推移，其中一家公司会再次成为主导。需要彻底的反思——以及当一种新方法的雏形开始呈现的时候，两种方法脱颖而出了。

The first is that antitrust authorities need to move from the industrial era into the 21st century. When considering a merger, for example, they have traditionally used size to determine when to intervene. They now need to take into account the extent of firms’ data assets when assessing the impact of deals. The purchase price could also be a signal that an incumbent is buying a nascent threat. On these measures, Facebook’s willingness to pay so much for WhatsApp, which had no revenue to speak of, would have raised red flags. Trustbusters must also become more data-savvy in their analysis of market dynamics, for example by using simulations to hunt for algorithms colluding over prices or to determine how best to promote competition (see Free exchange).

首先，反托拉斯法当局的思维需要从工业时代转换到二十一世纪。当考虑到企业合并，比如，他们会以企业的规模大小来决定什么时候开始干预。他们现在需要在评估交易影响的时候，考虑公司数据资产的规模。当公司现任者购买一个对其公司造成潜在威胁的产品时，购买价格也是其中一个信号。在这些措施中，脸书愿意花大价钱购买没有什么收入可言Whatsapp，这引发了危机。反托拉斯法联邦政府官员在对市场动态的分析中也变成了数据老手，比如，使用模拟来搜索与价格相关的算法或者决定如何最好地促进竞争。

The second principle is to loosen the grip that providers of online services have over data and give more control to those who supply them. More transparency would help: companies could be forced to reveal to consumers what information they hold and how much money they make from it. Governments could encourage the emergence of new services by opening up more of their own data vaults or managing crucial parts of the data economy as public infrastructure, as India does with its digital-identity system, Aadhaar. They could also mandate the sharing of certain kinds of data, with users’ consent—an approach Europe is taking in financial services by requiring banks to make customers’ data accessible to third parties.

第二个原则是放宽对在线服务供应商拥有数据和对提供数据的人的控制。更多的透明度将有助于：逼使公司向消费者透露，公司掌握了用户多少信息及从中赚了多少钱。政府能够鼓励更多的新服务——开放公司自身的数据库或者管理像公共基础设施那样的数据经济的重要部分，比如像印度的数据身份系统，Addhaar。他们还可以通过获得用户的同意，授权共享某一种数据的类型——欧洲正通过要求银行把客户访问的数据交由第三方的方法来获取金融服务。

Rebooting antitrust for the information age will not be easy. It will entail new risks: more data sharing, for instance, could threaten privacy. But if governments don’t want a data economy dominated by a few giants, they will need to act soon.

对于在信息时代重启反托拉斯法不是件容易的事儿。这将会引发新的风险：更多数据分享，比如，能威胁到个人隐私的数据。但是假如政府不希望让少数的巨头主宰数据经济，他们需要马上行动起来。
