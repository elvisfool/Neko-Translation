So what happened to the summit?

峰会将会发生什么？

1. Trumpian incompetence

1. 特朗普的失职

The common thread across the failures of the N Korea summit, Obamacare repeal, the wall, infrastructure, China trade, etc. is Trump’s laziness and disinterest in the grunt work required by his job. ‘Presidenting’ is hard, and Trump has neither the focus, attention span, critical faculties, or work ethic to do it well. Think LBJ constantly on the phone, working the bureaucracy, Congress, US allies, etc. Trump does not do this. He is so checked-out for his own presidency in policy terms, that large initiatives which require sustained executive leadership fail. Sec State Pompeo’s own commitment was not enough; POTUS himself needs to be involved. But Trump got more hung up on the pageantry and the Nobel hype.

贯穿朝美峰会的谈判失败，废除奥巴马医改，国内基础建设，与中国的贸易战等执政内容，都是特朗普对其工作要求作出懒政和漠不关心的表现。“做老大”是不容易的，特朗普无论在处理问题的聚焦能力，关注力持续时间，判断力还是职业道德都做得不好。想想林登·约翰逊不停地打电话，在官僚机构工作，国会，美国的盟友等，特朗普都不会做这些。他只关注他的总统任期。那些需要持续执行领导力的大型项目都失败了。国务卿蓬佩奥的承诺并不足够；也需要美国总统的介入；但是特朗普总是想着出席各种盛典和诺贝尔相关的炒作。


2. We offered the NKs almost nothing

2.我们几乎没给北韩什么

Demanding CVID up front for vague future promises of whatever was never going to work. That is the ‘Libya model,’ which was a terrible negotiating tactic, as that deal ended really badly for the Gaddafi government and G himself. Trump is great at belligerence & threats, but not at the giving-and-getting of diplomacy. Trump’s triumphalism, peaking with the preposterous notion that he should win a Nobel, likely told the NKs that Trump wanted to dictate surrender terms, rather the negotiate. This is why this whole thing should have started at the bottom, with professional diplomats slowly hammering out a deal through concession and counter-concession, building up toward an eventual summit. Hopefully that will happen now.

要求CVID提前为不明朗的未来做出并不会实现的承诺。这种“利比亚模式”是一种糟糕的谈判策略，这笔交易对于卡扎菲政府和其本人一样，结局非常糟糕。特朗普好强和威胁的作风，并不适用于礼尚往来的外交政策。特朗普的必胜信念，以他理应得到诺贝尔奖的荒谬想法一样，达到了登峰造极，好像直接告诉北韩不用谈判，抛出投降条款即可。这就是为什么整件事应该从另一个方向来操作，职业外交家用让步和反让步的方法慢慢推敲这个协议，为最终峰会做准备。希望这一切将会进行。

3. Lack of patience with NK shenanigans

3.对北韩的恶作剧缺乏耐心

Team Trump seems to have gotten quite upset that US staff in Singapore were stood up, and over NK’s harsh words for the vice-president. And so they should. But this is how NK negotiates. They have always done this sort of flim-flam: off-the-wall, 11th hour hijinks, outrageous demands, insult. If we are going to negotiate with them, we’re just going to have to learn to let this stuff roll off. Or, far better, start the negotiations at the bottom, deep in wonky staff-work without all the glare of global media attention where the NKs are better behaved.

特朗普团队似乎对美国人在新加坡被放鸽子以及北韩对副总统的严厉批评感到不满。他们确实应该生气。但这是北韩的谈判方式。而且他们经常干这种荒唐的事儿：疯癫的所作所为，最后一刻的狂欢，提出无理要求，辱骂对方。假如我们要与之谈判，必须要学会压制对方。又或者，更好的方法是与底层工作人员开展谈判。在不受全球媒体的关注——北韩在那个时候表现会更好——深入到喜怒无常的工作人员当中去。


4. Just too fast

4.一切都来得太快

The strategic & ideological divisions but the US and NK are very large. 
It was always heroic to suggest we could bridge them in just 9 weeks, esp. with Trump not bothering to put in the work. Historians will spend much time debating whether SK pushed this thing too fast onto someone woefully unready for the burden. But ultimately, SK prez Moon deserves credit for teeing up a huge opportunity for Trump – a deal of a lifetime for a guy who says he is a consummate dealer. And Trump, whose ‘deals’ mostly consisted of cons and like Trump University, blew it.There will be enough blame to go around – NK backsliding, SK overeagerness - but Trump will carry the lion’s share bc of his inability to buckle down and do the work – at minimum controlling his staff to keep Bolton from sabotaging Pompeo – in order to make this a success. END

无论是策略还是意识形态的分裂，美国和北韩都有很大的差异。尤其是，总有一些大无畏的建议，9周内就能把两国之间沟通的桥梁搭建起来。特朗普才懒得做这些。历史学家将花大量的时间去争辩，北韩是否让这一切发生得太快，以致于让人没有准备好去承担一切。但最终，值得称赞的是，南韩总统文在寅为特朗普创造了一个难得的机会。这对一个自称是精明商人的人来说，是一个一辈子的机会。而特朗普，他主要的“交易”都是骗得来的，比如特朗普大学，就搞砸了。还会有更多的指责——北韩的原形毕露，南韩太想谈判成功——但是特朗普将会承担起由于他的无能而无法完成这个任务的责任。至少他要防止Bloton（译者注：美国国家安全顾问）为了取得他的成功而故意破坏Pompeo的计划。
