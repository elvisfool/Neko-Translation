Brain-computer interfaces may change what it means to be human
脑机介面的变化对人类意味着什么


TECHNOLOGIES are often billed as transformative. For William Kochevar, the term is justified. Mr Kochevar is paralysed below the shoulders after a cycling accident, yet has managed to feed himself by his own hand. This remarkable feat is partly thanks to electrodes, implanted in his right arm, which stimulate muscles. But the real magic lies higher up. Mr KocheVar can control his arm using the power of thought. His intention to move is reflected in neural activity in his motor cortex; these signals are detected by implants in his brain and processed into commands to activate the electrodes in his arms.

技术通常被称为变革。对于威廉卡兹瓦来说，“技术”一词是有道理的。卡兹瓦先生在一场自行车意外后，肩膀以下瘫痪，然而他却还能用自己的手喂自己饭吃。这一非凡壮举部分归咎于植入他右臂刺激肌肉的电极。但真正的魔力还不在于此。卡兹瓦先生能够用他的思想控制他的手臂。他动作移动的想法反映在他运动皮质的神经活动上。这些信号被植入到他大脑探测到，同进处理成命令去激活他手臂内的电极。


An ability to decode thought in this way may sound like science fiction. But brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) like the Brain Gate system used by Mr Kochevar provide evidence that mind-control can work. Researchers are able to tell what words and images people have heard and seen from neural activity alone. Information can also be encoded and used to stimulate the brain. Over 300,000 people have cochlear implants, which help them to hear by converting sound into electrical signals and sending them into the brain. Scientists have “injected” data into monkeys’ heads, instructing them to perform actions via electrical pulses.

以这种解码思想能力的方法听起来就像科幻小说。	但是脑机介面(BCIs)听起来就像是被卡兹瓦先生使用的大脑门系统一样，提供了精神控制可以工作的证据。研究者可以分辨出人们从神经活动中听到和看到的文字以及图片。超过30万人植入了耳蜗，这些耳蜗将会帮助他们将声音转换成电信号同时发送到他们的大脑。科学家们“注射”了一些数据在猴子的大脑中，通过电脉冲指挥它们去执行一些动作。


A sour Technology Quarterly in this issue explains, the pace of research into BCIs and the scale of its ambition are increasing. Both America’s armed forces and Silicon Valley are starting to focus on the brain. Facebook dreams of thought-to-text typing. Kernel, a startup, has$100m to spend on neurotechnology. Elon Muskh as formed a firm called Neura link; he thinks that, if humanity is to survive the advent of artificial intelligence, it needs an upgrade. Entrepreneurs envisage a world in which people can communicate telepathically, with each other and with machines, or acquire superhuman abilities, such as hearing at very high frequencies.

在这个问题上，令人失望的《技术季刊》这样解释，BCIs的研究步伐和野心在增长。同时美国军方和硅谷开始把注意力集中在大脑方面。脸书的梦想是思想转成文字输入。内核，一个新创公司，已经在神经技术方面花费了1亿美元。爱伦马施成立了一家公司称为神经链；他认为，如果人类想在人工智能时代中生存下来必须要升级。企业家们面临一个人类能够进行心灵感应交流的世界，人类彼此交流，或者用机器交流，又或者获得超能力，比如能听到非常高频的声音。


These powers, if they ever materialise, are decades away. But well before then, BCIs could open the door to remarkable new applications. Imagine stimulating the visual cortex to help the blind, forging new neural connections in stroke victims or monitoring the brain for signs of depression. By turning the firing of neurons in to a resource to be harnessed, BCIs may change the idea of what it means to be human.

这些科技如果能成为现实也要几十年后了。但在那儿之前，BCIs能够打开一扇非凡新应用的大门。图片刺激到视觉皮层从而帮助盲人，在中风患者中建立新的神经连接或者监测有抑郁症出现迹象的大脑。把神经元放电转化为一种可以利用的资源，BCIs能够改变这种对人类有意义的观念。


That thinking feeling
这种想法的感觉
Sceptics scoff. Taking medical BCIs out of the lab into clinical practice has proved very difficult. The Brain Gate system used by Mr Kochevar was developed more than ten years ago, but only a handful of people have tried it out. Turning implants into consumer products is even harder to imagine. The path to the mainstream is blocked by three formidable barriers—technological, scientific and commercial.

怀疑论者对此嗤之以鼻。把医学BCIs从实验室中搬到临床实践中验证是非常困难的。被卡兹瓦先生所用的大脑门系统在十年前就发展了，但是只在少量人群中被测试。难以想像将植入物变成商品。有三个强有力的障碍阻挡了主流观念——技术，科学和商业。

Start with technology. Non-invasive techniques like an electroencephalogram (EEG) struggle to pick up high-resolution brain signals through intervening layers of skin, bone and membrane. Some advances are being made—on EEG caps that can be used to play virtual-reality games or control industrial robots using thought alone. But for the time being at least, the most ambitious applications require implants that can interact directly with neurons. And existing device shave lots of drawbacks. They involve wires that passthrough the skull; they provoke immune responses; they communicate with only a few hundred of the 85bn neurons in the human brain. But that could soon change. Helped by advances in miniaturization and increased computing power, efforts are under way to make safe, wireless implants that can communicate with hundreds of thousands of neurons. Some of these interpret the brain’s electrical signals; others experiment with light, magnetism and ultrasound.

由技术开始。非侵入式技术希望脑电图（EEG）努力通过介入皮肤，骨骼和黏膜来捕捉高分辨率的脑信号。一些先进的技术已经形成——用EEG来玩虚拟现实游戏或者用意念来控制工业机器人。但至少现在是这样的，最雄心勃勃的应用要求植入体能够直接与神经做交互。现有的设备也有许多缺点。它们包含穿过头骨的电线；引起了免疫反应；只能在大脑中与850亿中的几百个神经做交流。但不久以后都会改变。在小型化和计算机能力增强的研究进展的帮助下，正努力使其变得安全，无线植入体能够与成千上万的神经进行交流。其中一些负责翻译大脑的电子信号，其它用光，磁力和超声波做实验。


Clear the technological barrier, and another one looms. The brain is still a foreign country. Scientists know little about how exactly it works, especially when it comes to complex functions like memory formation. Research is more advanced in animals, but experiments on humans are hard. Yet, even today, some parts of the brain, like the motor cortex, are better understood. Nor is complete knowledge always needed. Machine learning can recognise patterns of neural activity; the brain itself gets the hang of controlling BCIS with extraordinary ease. And neurotechnology will reveal more of the brain’s secrets.

一个是清除技术障碍，另外的则迫在眉目。大脑对于我们而言依然是个不太了解的世界。科学家对其如何运作还是知之甚少，尤其是涉及到复杂的功能譬如记忆的形成。科学家有着对动物更先进的研究，但是对人类却很难。然而，即使在今天，对大脑的一些部分，像运动皮质区，有着更好的理解。也不一定需要完整的知识。机器学习能够辨别神经活动的模式；大脑非常轻松就能拥有控制BCIS的窍门。而神经技术则会揭露出大脑更多的秘密。


Like a hole in the head 
就像头上的一个洞
The third obstacle comprises the practical barriers to commercialisation. It takes time, money and expertise to get medical devices approved. And consumer applications will take off only if they perform a function people find useful. Some of the applications for brain-computer interfaces are unnecessary—a good voice-assistant is a simpler way to type without fingers than a brain implant, for example. The idea of consumers clamouring for craniotomies also seems far-fetched. Yet brain implants are already an established treatment for some conditions. Around 150,000 people receive deep-brain stimulation via electrodes to help them control Parkinson’s disease. Elective surgery can become routine, as laser-eye procedures show.

第三个干扰包含了商业化的操作障碍。要得到医疗设备批准，需要时间，金钱和专业知识。只有当消费者发现操作功能生效时，消费应用才能推广。一些对于脑机介面的应用是不必要的——比如，一个好的语音助手是一种比大脑植入更简单且不需要手指的输入方法。一些消费者呼吁开颅术似乎也是八杆子打不着。然而，在某些情况下，大脑植入体已经是一种既定的治疗方法。约15万人通过电极的帮助接受了脑深层刺激手术，帮助其控制帕金森病症。正如激光眼科手术显示的那样，选择性外科手术正成为常规。

All of which suggests that a route to the future imagined by the neurotech pioneers is arduous but achievable. When human ingenuity is applied to a problem, however hard, it is unwise to bet against it. Within a few years, improved technologies may be opening up new channels of communications with the brain. Many of the first applications hold out unambiguous promise—of movement and senses restored. But as uses move to the augmentation of abilities, whether for military purposes or among consumers, a host of concerns will arise. Privacy is an obvious one: the refuge of an inner voice may disappear. Security is another: if a brain can be reached on the internet, it can also be hacked. Inequality is a third: access to superhuman cognitive abilities could be beyond all except a self-perpetuating elite. Ethicists are already starting to grapple with questions of identity and agency that arise when a machine is in the neural loop.

所有一切技术先峰所设想的未来之路是严峻的，但都是可以实现的。当人类的才知用来面对问题时，无论多么艰难，都能得到解决。在几年之内，技术的改进也许能为与大脑交流打开一扇门。许多先期的应用都明确地承诺运动和功能的恢复。但随着从使用转换到能力的增强时，无论在军事目的还是消费者当中，都出现一系列的担忧。隐私是最显而易见的一个原因：所思所想也许会被察觉。另外的安全问题：假如大脑能连接到互联网，也能被入侵。第三个问题是不平等：获得超人认知能力超越除了永续精英外的所有人。伦理学家正在着手解决当机器出现在神经回路时身份和代理的问题。

These questions are not urgent. But the bigger story is that neither are they the realm of pure fantasy. Technology changes the way people live. Beneath the skull lies the next frontier.

这些问题并不紧急。但是最大的问题是它们都不是纯粹幻想的领域。技术改变了人类生存的方式。在头骨下存在下一个技术前沿。
