Money managers are having a change of heart.

基金经理们正改变看法。

That’s according to a Strategas Research Partners survey of roughly 500 institutional investors, 70 percent of whom now expect the S&P 500 Index to stay above its low of 2,581 reached on Feb. 8. That’s a turnaround from four months ago, when the majority said the worst had yet to come.


根据战略研究伙伴对约500家机构投资者做的调查，其中70%希望标普500能停留在二月八日的2581低位上与在四个月前相比有了转机，当大多数投资者说最坏的情况还没到来的时候。

The S&P 500 came within 1 point of the February low in April and has since gained about 5 percent. Yet, sentiment is far from exuberant. Money managers in the latest Strategas survey predicted the index would end the year at 2,842, a level that’s still short of its January peak of 2,873.

标普500指数在四月份跌至二月份低位还低一个点，之后上涨约5%。然而，市场情绪低落。基金经理在最近的战略研究伙伴调查中指出，标普指数在年底会收于2842点，仍低于一月份的峰值2873点。
 
“Sentiment is less bullish, but we would stop short of calling investors bearish,” strategists led by Chris Verrone wrote in a note to clients.

“市场情绪不太乐观，但是我们不会让投资者失跌行情，” 以克里斯•弗隆(Chris Verrone)为首的策略师在一份致客户的报告中写道。

Among other findings from the poll, Europe and health-care stocks are the least favored. Slightly more than half of the respondents expect two more Fed rate hikes this year and the consensus on 10-year Treasuries is that yields would hover near 3 percent in December.

在其它的调查结果中，欧洲和医疗保健类股最不受欢迎的。略过半的受访者预计美联储今年加息两次以及对10年期美国国债收益率的共识是，在12月份时会在3%左右徘徊。

Almost 60 percent of Strategas clients believe the Republicans will maintain control of the House in November, an upward revision from prior surveys earlier this year.

近60%的战略研究伙伴客户相信，共和党将在11月份保持对众议院的控制，这是对今年早些时候的调查作出的修正。
