Local residents often turn a blind eye to trafficking
本地人对人口贩卖熟视无睹

HUONG was only 15 when she went out to meet a friend in Lao Cai, a city in northern Vietnam on the Chinese border (see map). She thought she would be gone a few hours, but it was three years before she managed to return home. Her friend had brought with her two acquaintances—young men with motorcycles. They squired the girls around town and took them to a karaoke bar, where their drinks were spiked.

当红在老街市出去和朋友见面时只有15岁，这是一座位于越南北部靠近中国边境的城市(参考地图)。她以为只是出去几个小时，但在她决定回家前已经有三年了。她的朋友带来两个她的熟人——年轻人骑着摩托车。他们带着女孩们在镇上闲逛并去了卡拉OK厅，在那儿他们喝醉了。

When the girls grew drowsy they were hoisted back onto the bikes, each sandwiched between two male riders. They were driven into the hills and across the Chinese border to a remote house in the countryside. There they were told they would be sold. The girls screamed and cried but were subdued by two men, one of them wielding a stick. The traffickers told Huong that by crossing the border she had sullied her reputation, but that if she behaved well they would find her a Chinese husband. After marrying she might find a way home, they said. If she refused she would stay stranded in the hills.

当两个女孩醉醺醺的时候被抬到自行车上，由两个骑车的男人把她们夹在中间。她们被送到山里并且穿过中国边境，被送到农村一个遥远的家庭中。在那儿，有人告诉她们，她们被卖了。女孩们开始尖叫和哭泣，但是被两个男人制服了，其中一人挥动棍子。贩毒者们告诉红，只要穿过边境，她的名声就毁了，但如果她表现得好，就给她就找个好丈夫。他们说，结婚后，她可以找到回家的路。假如她拒绝，就把她扔到山里。

Huong—a pseudonym, to protect her identity—is now 20 years old. She lives in a large bungalow in Lao Cai, which she shares with a dozen women aged between 15 and 24 (an occupant is pictured). They are all survivors of trafficking networks that smuggle girls across the Vietnam-China border, sometimes to be sold as prostitutes but more often as brides. Their house, with its enormous teddy bears and fleet of fuchsia-pink bicycles, is a shelter run by Pacific Links Foundation, an American charity, which helps victims finish their education and cope with their trauma. 

红——是个假名，为了保护她的隐私——现年20岁。她住在老街市一座很大的房子里，在那里她和一些15到24岁的妇女住在一起（图中是一个居住者）。她们是越中贩卖人口网络的幸存者，有时候被当作妓女但更多时候当作新娘被出售。她们的房子——有很多泰迪熊和粉红色的自行车——是由环太平洋基金会建立的庇护站，这是一个美国慈善机构，这个机构帮助许多的受害人完成教育并且治愈创伤。

Around the world some 15m people are living in marriages into which they were forced, including some who were abducted, according to a recent study by the International Labour Organisation, a UN body, and human-rights groups. In China the trafficking of women is particularly acute, in part because a preference for sons has left the country with a severely skewed sex ratio. Between 1979 and 2015 the imbalance was aggravated by a one-child-per-couple policy, which prompted many to abort females before they were born. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences has estimated that by 2020 there will be 30m-40m Chinese men who will be unable to find wives in their own country.

通过国际劳工组织，联合国的一些机构以及人权团体的一些调查发现，包括一些被诱拐的，全球约有1500万人生活在强迫婚姻中。在中国女性的贩卖情况尤其严重，部分原因是重男轻女使得这个国家的性别比例严重失衡。在1979年到2015年间，独生子女政策使得这种失衡恶化了。中国社会科学院估计到2020年，将会有3000万到4000万的中国男性在本国找不到妻子。

One consequence of this is booming business for matchmakers who offer to import women from China’s poorer neighbours, particularly Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam, Mongolia and North Korea. Some of these women, seeking a route out of poverty at home, freely choose a Chinese marriage and gain the necessary approvals. But along China’s borders, kidnapping is rife.

这对婚姻中介来说是一个具大的市场，中介们从中国周边贫穷的国家，特别是老挝、缅甸、柬埔寨、越南、蒙古和北韩，提供进口的女性到中国。其中一些妇女在国内寻求摆脱贫穷的方法，自由地选择嫁到中国以及获得一些自由。但在中国的边境上，绑架却是常事儿。

The stories told by trafficking survivors and Vietnamese officials in Lao Cai shed light on this grim trade. Each year between 100 and 150 trafficked Vietnamese women return to their country through the town’s border gate, says an official there—probably only a small proportion of the total who are lured or abducted the other way. Some of the victims’ ordeals begin when, like Huong, they are drugged or kidnapped. Others are duped into thinking they are going to a party or to meet a potential boyfriend. Sometimes members of their own families are complicit.

这个故事让人口贩卖幸存者和老街的越南官员清楚这个非法交易的严重性。在那里的官员说，每年有100至150个被贩卖的越南妇女通过中越边境被送返本国，这可能只是以诱拐和绑架的方式贩卖的人口总数的一小部分。一些受害人——像红——被灌醉或者绑架时，痛苦才刚开始。其他人也许还沉醉在要去一个聚会或者会见自己心仪的男朋友当中。有时家庭成员也是帮凶。

Diep Vuong of Pacific Links thinks victims are getting younger (in China, women have to be at least 20 to get married, but marriages to abducted foreigners are often unregistered). The spread of cheap smartphones and improvements in mobile networks are making it easier for traffickers to use social media to befriend schoolgirls in Vietnam’s hills. These criminals earn as little as $50 for each woman they bring into China, where they are often resold far inland by middlemen. Chinese police report that at their final destination Vietnamese women fetch prices of between around 60,000 and 100,000 yuan ($9,000-15,000).

环太平洋的迪普·翁认为，受害人年轻化（在中国，妇女要求到少20岁才能结婚，但是被绑架的外国人的婚姻无须登记）。廉价智能手机的普及和移动网络的提升，对于人口贩子用社交媒体在越南山里和学校女生交朋友变得更容易了。这些罪犯从每个送往中国的女性身上仅仅得到50美元，在中国他们通过中间商把这些妇女出售到内陆。中国警方的报告称，这些越南妇女在最终的目的地的价格是60000至100，000人民币（9000到15000美元）。

Some snatched women and girls return home swiftly. A 17-year-old who lives at the bungalow with Huong says she was gone for only two days before a woman on the Chinese side of the border helped her to escape. A fellow resident, who returned from China a month ago, walks with a limp. She says she broke her leg leaping from the house in which her traffickers were holding her. Chinese police later found her lying in the street.

一些被抓走的妇女和女孩很快就回家了。一名17岁和红住在平房的女孩说，中国边境那边的一名妇女帮助她逃跑前，她已经走了两天。一位居民，从中国被送返一个月前，一直瘸脚。她说，人贩子一直把她困在那屋子里，她从屋子上跳来摔断了脚。中国警察最后发现她躺在街上。

Huong’s story is longer. She was kept at her traffickers’ house and threatened for two months. When she finally agreed to be married she was driven for two days to a city in Anhui, a province north-west of Shanghai. She was warned not to let her new family find out that she was Vietnamese. She was to pretend to be a Chinese citizen belonging to an ethnic minority with cross-border cultural links.

红的故事更长。她被关在人贩子的家里，被威胁了两个月。当她最终同意嫁到中国后，她坐了两天的车被送到安徽的一个城市，这是位于上海西北的一个省份。她被警告，不要让中国家庭知道她是越南人。她要伪装成有着不同文化背景的中国少数民族。

The man to whom she was sold into marriage was in his early 20s. He was from a wealthy family, which had paid 90,000 yuan for her. Her husband explained that he had not really wanted to get married, but that his parents were keen. They had told him that an ethnic-minority bride would be more obedient than someone from the ethnic-Han majority. Such claims are commonly made by matchmakers. One Chinese mail-order marriage site says Vietnamese women are cheap, obedient and unlikely to run away: they are “so gentle and loving they will make you melt”.

把她卖给那个男人也就20岁出头。他来自于一个富裕的家庭，他为此付了90,000元人民币。他的丈夫告诉她，他并不想结婚，只是他父母的要求。父母告诉他，一个少数民族的妻子比汉族的妻子更加的温顺。中介通常都是这样声称的。

The greatest demand for foreign wives is in the countryside, particularly among men who are poor or disabled, says Jiang Quanbao of Xi’an Jiaotong University. In rural areas not only is the sex ratio an impediment to finding a bride, so too is the migration of women to the cities in search of work and higher-status males. Impoverished villages sometimes end up with dozens of foreign wives, as word spreads of their availability.

西安交通大学的江全宝（音译）说，在农村有着对外国新娘最大的需要，特别是那些贫穷而有有残疾的单身男性。在农村不仅是性别比例造成寻找妻子的障碍，而且在城市中迁徙的女性也在寻找职业和条件好的男性。一条贫穷的山村有时会有十几个外国妻子，她们的好处被传播开来。

Villagers often have sympathy for the buyers—they may even help to prevent trafficked women from fleeing. Escape is not at all simple for women without money of their own and with limited Chinese-language skills. North Koreans who contact the authorities risk being repatriated and then sent to concentration camps. That makes them particularly vulnerable to traffickers. Amid rising tensions on the Korean peninsula caused by North Korea’s nuclear tests, police in nearby Chinese provinces are becoming more watchful for unauthorised migrants from across the border, including North Korean women who have been sold into marriage.

村里人常常对买家抱有同情心——他们可能会阻止这些被贩卖妇女的逃跑。对于没有钱的妇女和有限的中文能力的妇女来说，逃跑并非易事。脱北者只要接触到政府就有被遣返的风险，然后送到集中营。这使得他们特别容易受到人贩子的要挟。北韩核试验导致朝鲜半岛局势不断升级，在附近省份的警察对跨境的非法移民变得十分警惕，包括被嫁到中国的北韩妇女。

Once victims become mothers, their decisions about whether and how to leave China become even more difficult. So it was for Huong. She had been taken to Anhui with another Vietnamese girl who was being sold into the same district. The pair agreed that they would find a way home together. But their plan had to be postponed soon after arrival, because Huong’s friend became pregnant. By the time the baby was delivered Huong was expecting a child, too. Less than a month after she gave birth, Huong’s in-laws sent her to live and work at a textile factory nearly four hours away, leaving her baby behind. Her husband would turn up on payday to collect most of her wages—about 6,000 yuan a month. Eventually Huong concluded that the family meant to keep her estranged from her daughter. She resolved to escape back to Vietnam.

一名受害者成为了母亲，决定是否或如何离开中国变得更加艰难。红也一样。她和另一个被卖到和她同一区的越南女孩被带到安徽。她们商量想办法一起回越南。在她们到达后，计划被拖延了，因为红的朋友怀孕了。在那个孩子出生后，红也在等待分娩。在她分娩后不到一个月，她的公婆让她离开她的孩子 ，到四个小时车程外的一个纺织厂生活和工作。她的丈夫出现在发薪日，并拿走了大部分的薪水——约每月6000元。最终，红得出一个结论，这个家庭就是让她疏远她的女儿。她下定决心逃回越南。

Huong scraped together enough money to travel independently. Her own parents, whom she had managed to contact a few months after reaching Anhui, helped her work out where best to present herself to the authorities. The Chinese police kept her for three months while they investigated her story, after which they arrested some of the people involved in trafficking her. Then they sent her back to Vietnam, though her baby remained in China.

红凑够了钱独自出发。她在到达安徽后曾设法联系她的父母几个月，他们帮助她找到当局并告之这一切，当中国警察调查她的案子的时候，警察把她关了三个月，之后他们逮捕了这个案件中贩卖她的一些人。

 In June the American government reported that China was “not making significant efforts” to tackle human trafficking. It relegated China to the ranks of countries, such as Venezuela, Turkmenistan and South Sudan, which it rates as the worst for their record in dealing with the problem. 
But Chinese police say they are not sitting on their hands. They report that between 2009 and the middle of last year, they “rescued several thousand women of foreign nationality” in anti-trafficking operations that involved co-operation with their counterparts in Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos (pictured are victims being sent back to Vietnam by Chinese police in 2015). More than 1,000 people were arrested for related crimes.

六月份，美国政府报告说，中国没有“做出有效行动”解决人口贩卖活动。将中国降级为与委内瑞拉、土库曼斯坦和南苏丹同等级别的国家，它们被看作是解决这些问题有着最糟糕记录的国家。但中国警方称，他们并非不作为。他们报道，在2009年到去年中期，他们在反人口贩卖行动中“救出几千名外国籍妇女”，这包括与越南、缅甸和老挝合作的行动（图中所示越南受害人在2015年被中国警方送返，超过1000名相关的罪犯被捕）。

In some provinces government registrars are trying to spot unwilling foreign brides by hiring staff with knowledge of regional languages. The government says that stricter policing last year in the borderlands reduced trafficking from Vietnam.

在某些省份，政府注册服务机构正尝试雇用拥过本地语言技能的人来发现这些外籍新娘。政府说，去年在边境加强了监管以便减少从越南的人口贩卖。

It is difficult, however, to prosecute people for buying abducted women. In 2015 the law was revised to make legal action easier. But the law says that, in cases where the woman wants to return and the buyer does not try to prevent it, punishment can be lighter or the sentence can be commuted. Cross-border operations remain hostage to China’s relations with its neighbours. Ties with Vietnam, an age-old rival, are often frosty.

然而，去起诉这些购买被绑架新娘的人很困难。在2015年，法律进行了修订，使法律行动更容易执行。但是法律声明，如果女性想返回本国，买家不能阻止，惩罚变轻同时可以得到减刑。跨境的行为受制于中国与邻国的关系。和一个年代久远的竞争对手——越南——保持关系，常常会陷入僵局。

Huong is now finishing high school, and hopes to study medicine. She says she “will not regret” having to leave her daughter in China. A baby would have been a burden on her family in Vietnam, and she worried that having no father would thrust the child into a legal limbo. Her in-laws were wealthy, at least, and seemed devoted to her daughter, she says. They were “good people.”

红现在正在修读高中课程，希望能学习医学知识。她说她“将不会后悔”离开留在中国的女儿。这个婴儿会成为越南家庭的负担，她担心没有父亲的孩子将会把孩子推到法律的边缘。她的公婆是富有的，看起来也会对女儿很好。她说，他们都是“好人”。
