It would be good to learn more about the North Korean leader’s thinking

TO SUPPORTERS of Donald Trump, March 8th’s news that the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un wants to meet America’s president, and soon, only goes to prove the potency of a foreign policy that blends toughness with just a dash of crazy. To Trump’s sceptics, it is as obvious that such an unprecedented summit would be a terrifying gamble. After the announcement that Mr Trump is willing to meet Mr Kim as soon as May, much of the professional Korea-watching community rose up on social media and cable news to deplore the blustering, impulsive and fact-scorning 45th president as the last man they would send to negotiate with the ruthless, carefully prepared North Korean regime.

对于特朗普的支持者来说，三月八号——关于北韩领袖金正恩期望与特朗普见面——的新闻，很快，仅仅证明了这只是一个既棘手又有点疯狂的特朗普外交政策的结果。对于特朗普的怀疑者而言，这个史无前例的会面是一场可怕的赌博是显而易见的。在特朗普可能在五月会见金正恩的声明发布后，无数专业的韩国观察团体在社交媒体和有线电视上掀起了狂风雷暴般的讨论，对这位气势汹汹，冲动以及对实事不屑一顾的第45届美国总统表示遗憾，他是最后一个被派去和无情，精心准备的北韩政权进行谈判的人。

Each camp has a point. Successive American administrations have spent years on cautious, painstaking diplomacy with the Kim family dynasty, backed by a judicious mix of sanctions and bribes. After each deal was reached the North Koreans pocketed the aid and concessions on offer, broke their word and returned to their decades-long quest to develop nuclear weapons. At best, all that expertise and patience might have slowed North Korea’s path to a bomb by a few years.

每一个阵营都有自己的立场。历届美国政府多年来谨慎行事，与金家王朝困境重重的外交，以制裁和贿赂为明智组合作为其后盾。在北韩达成交易之后，都把援助和让步置之脑后，食言并且重回他们数十年在核武器上的发展。最好的情况下，所有的专业知识和耐心可能会在几年内使北韩成为一个炸弹。


Now America is giving bluster and incoherence a go. This blogger has been told by Asian diplomats that—for all that they blench when Mr Trump mocks the 34-year old Mr Kim as “Little Rocket Man” or boasts about the size of America’s nuclear button—they can see a value to challenging the North Koreans in the field of unpredictability, which the Stalinist state has had to itself for so long. It is also the case that North Korea’s ailing planned economy faces its toughest-ever sanctions—even if China continues to supply its neighbour with energy and food, fearing that the regime’s collapse could create a hostile, unified Korea on its border.

现在，美国正发出咆哮和语无伦次的声音。这位博主已经被亚洲外交官——他们都回避了这话题——告之，当特朗普嘲笑34岁的金正恩是“火箭人”或吹嘘美国核按钮的尺寸时，他们能够看到在不可预测的领域挑战北韩人的价值。事实上北韩境况不佳的计划经济也在面临着最严厉的制裁——即使中国继续向其邻国提供能源和食品，担心专制的倒台会在边境制造一个敌对的，统一的韩国。

The trio of envoys sent by South Korea’s president Moon Jae-in to meet the North Koreans, and then sent to Washington to brief Mr Trump, ascribed their optimism to the American president’s forceful approach. South Korea’s national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, emerged from the White House to tell the press that he wished to thank Mr Trump’s “wonderful national-security team” and had “explained to President Trump that his leadership and his maximum-pressure policy, together with international solidarity, brought us to this juncture.” Mr Chung added that Mr Kim had told him he is “committed to denuclearisation” and had promised to refrain from further tests of missiles and warheads.

南韩总统文在寅派了三个使节前往北韩，随后派他们到华盛顿向特朗普汇报，他们乐观的态度归因于美国的强硬态度。南韩国家安全顾问郑义溶从白宫出来后告诉传媒，希望感谢特朗普“优秀的国家安全团队”和“已经向特朗普解释他的领导以能力及最大限度施加压力的政策，与国际社会团结一致，把我们带到了这个关头上”,郑义溶补充说，金正恩告诉他将“致力于无核化”，并且承诺在未来不再进行导弹和弹头的测试。

But sceptics are also right to fear that Mr Trump—a man who boasts about his television ratings, and who is bored by briefings and scornful of foreign alliances—could end up being played like a gold-plated violin. There is nothing new about a North Korean despot proposing a meeting with an American president, or expressing warm words about denuclearisation in return for security guarantees, by which the Kim regime usually means the withdrawal of American troops from the Korean peninsula and the breaking of treaty alliances with South Korea and Japan. effrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies flung an especially scornful thread onto the Twittersphere, noting: “North Korea has been seeking a summit with an American president for more than twenty years. It has literally been a top foreign policy goal of Pyongyang since Kim Jong Il invited Bill Clinton. I wonder if Trump’s “aides” have explained that to him. Or, if in their toddler-handling, they have led him to believe that this offer is something unusual. Or perhaps he imagines that only he can go Pyongyang [sic].” It is not reassuring that Team Trump is so thinly staffed: the administration has not even managed to nominate an ambassador to South Korea. Its North Korean special envoy, the senior diplomat Joseph Yun, announced his retirement in February. 

怀疑论者也有理由担心特朗普——一个常吹嘘自己有能耐以及对简报感到厌烦和蔑视外国联盟的人——最终被人摆了一道。北韩独裁者没有什么新鲜事儿，提议与美国总统会晤，或者出于对安全保障的回报说一些无核化的漂亮话，而无核化对于金家王朝意味着美国在朝鲜半岛撤军以及与日韩打破条约联盟。米德尔伯里国际研究所的艾弗里·刘易斯在推特上轻蔑地表示，指出“北韩在过去二十年里一直寻求机会与美国会晤，自从金正日邀请比尔克林顿以来，这确实是平壤的最高的外交政策目标。我猜如果特朗普的“助手”向他解释的话，或者，在他们幼稚的外交处理方法中，他们使得他相信这不是个寻常的提议。或者也许他想象只有他才能到平壤。”特朗普团队的人手如此薄弱，这实在不能令人放心：政府甚至没能提名一名驻韩大使。其北韩特使，高级外交官司约瑟夫·云在二月份宣布退休。

And yet, as word of the summit pinged around the internet and barged onto newspaper front pages already crowded with Trump-news, a third camp made itself heard, arguing that maybe this time is different. Strikingly, if members of this group think that a historic chance for peace might just be within reach, their hopes have little to do with Mr Trump’s personality. Instead, their judgment reflects a grim new reality. After a string of rapid breakthroughs with long-range missiles and tests of nuclear explosives, North Korea may feel it is in a position to negotiate with the Americans as something close to an equal.

然而，随着"峰会"这个词在传遍了网络以及登上了全是特朗普新闻的头版。一个第三阵营听到，认为这次也许会和以往不同。尤其是，假如组织成员认为这个和平的历史机会是触手可及的话，他们的希望与特朗普的个性并无太多关联。事实上，他们的判断反应了一个新的冷酷无情的事实。在一连串技术得到突破的远程导弹和核炸药测试后，北韩可能觉得有能力和美国进行谈判，当某些关系对等时。

James Clapper, a career military intelligence officer who rose to become Director of National Intelligence during Barack Obama’s presidency, serving from 2010 to 2017, has had harsh things to say about Mr Trump. 
But he cautiously welcomed talk of a Trump-Kim summit. If still in office, he would recommend that the president go, he said. “But I would advise that he do something that doesn’t come easily to Donald Trump, which is to listen. We need to hear from Kim Jong Un himself what it would take for him to feel secure,” General Clapper told this blogger (in the interests of transparency: the conversation took place in the backstage green room at CNN). In 2014 the general was sent to Pyongyang on a secret mission to bring back two Americans being held in North Korea. While there, he recalled, the North Koreans had stressed their desire for a full-scale peace treaty with America, to replace the ceasefire that ended the Korean war. Yes, the former spy chief conceded, the North Koreans have ambitions to push American forces out of their region. But that is no reason not to talk. “I think they may be feeling confident now that whatever they have is enough that they would not be meeting the president as a supplicant.”

詹姆斯·克莱帕——一名职业军事情报官员在奥巴马时期升职为国家情报主任，在2010年任职至2017年——对特朗普有一些苛刻的言论。但是他对韩美会晤持谨慎态度。假如他仍然在职，他表示，他会建议总统与之会晤，“但是我会建议他做一些对于特朗普来说不那么容易的事儿，那就是倾听。我们需要倾听来自金正恩本人感到有安全感的心声。”克拉帕将军告诉这位博主（为了提高透明度：会谈在CNN后台的绿色房间里进行）。在2014年将军被派去平壤执行一个秘密任务，带回两名被关押在北韩的美国人。在那时，他回忆道，北韩曾强调希望与美国达成全面和平条约的意愿，以结束朝鲜战争取代停火协议。是的，这名前情报局长承认，北韩有这个野心把美国军队赶出他们的区域。但是没有理由不进行会谈。“我认为他们现在也许感到自信，无论他们拥有什么，都足以让他们不以恳求者的方式与总统见面。”

Presented as an intelligence-gathering mission, a Trump-Kim summit does sounds potentially useful. In North Korea, nothing carries so much weight as the words of Kim Jong Un, third-generation leader of the world’s only hereditary Stalinist regime. A spectacular meeting with the world’s most famous man might strike Mr Kim as a moment worthy of candour.

作为一个情报搜集的任务，特朗普与金正恩的会晤似乎有用。在北韩，没有什么比金正恩——世界上唯一世袭的斯大林政权的第三代领导人——的话更有份量了。与世界上最有名的人举行的精彩会谈也许能使金正恩觉得这是坦诚的。

Still allies have grounds to worry. Mr Trump may have something more ambitious in mind than a listening exercise. Reporters asked a senior administration official why a face-to-face leaders’ meeting did not need to be preceded by rounds of talks by lower-level officials. He said.

盟友们仍然有担心的理由。特朗普也许有着比倾听更有野心的事。记者们问及一名高级政府官员为何在一个面对面的领袖会晤前不需要由低级官员进行几轮会谈作。他回答说。

President Trump made his reputation on making deals. Kim Jong Un is the one person who is able to make decisions under their authoritarian—uniquely authoritarian—or totalitarian system. And so it made sense to accept an invitation to meet with the one person who can actually make decisions instead of repeating the, sort of, long slog of the past.

特朗普在生意场上有享有声誉。金正恩——唯一的独裁者——一名在专制体制或极权系统中做决定的人。接受这样的邀请，与一位真正做出决定，而不是重复走过去各种弯路的人进行会面是有意义的。

What could be more satisfying than a sudden, historic deal to make all those mocking experts and diplomats eat their words? And to pull off a quick win, Mr Trump the salesman has long been willing to promise anything—especially when someone else will pay the price for failure.

还有什么比那些突然的，历史性的协议令所有那些发出嘲笑声的专家和外交官食言更令人感到满意的呢？为了迅速取得胜利，特朗普这个推销员一直以来愿意做出各种承诺——特别是其他人为了失败而付出代价的时候。
