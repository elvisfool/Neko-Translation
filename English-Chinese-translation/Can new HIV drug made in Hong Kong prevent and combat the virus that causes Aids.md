Can new HIV drug made in Hong Kong prevent and combat the virus that causes Aids?

香港制造的新型HIV药物能防止和对抗引起爱滋病的病毒吗？

A team led by scientists from the University of Hong Kong is confident their scientific discovery, which has only been tested on mice so far, can protect people from contracting HIV and also treat the virus 

一个由香港大学科学家领导的小组对其科学发明充满信心，这项发现到目前为止仅在老鼠身上做过测试，能保护人类不受HIV感染，同时也能治疗病毒。

A team led by scientists from the University of Hong Kong has developed a new antibody drug that will not only protect people from contracting HIV but also serve as a long-acting treatment for the virus, unlike current medication that must be taken daily.

一个由香港大学科学家组成的团队已经开发了一种新的抗体药物，不仅能保护人类免于感染HIV，还可以对病毒进行长效治疗，不像现在的药物那样需要每天服用。

But there will need to be a further battery of tests before the drug, named “BiIA-SG”, can be part of the global battle against the virus, which causes Aids.

但在该药物被命名为“BiIA-SG”前，他们将需要进一步的测试，这可能成为全球对抗引起爱滋病病毒的一部分。

The research team has so far only tested the drug on mice but is now looking to experiment on larger animals such as monkeys, before conducting clinical trials on humans. 

Still, Professor Chen Zhiwei, the team leader and director of HKU’s Aids Institute, stressed the scientific discovery had yielded “one of the most potent and effective antibody drugs”.

尽管如此，香港大学爱滋病研究所团队负责人兼主任陈志伟（音译），强调科学发现已经产生了“其中一种最强有力和有效的抗体药物”。

This is because the study showed that mice given the drug before being infected with HIV were protected from the virus for about a week.

这是因为研究表明，老鼠在被HIV感染之前服用该药物，约在一周内不会受到病毒的感染。

In addition, the experiments, which also involved experts from mainland medical and research institutions, found that when mice were infected with HIV before being treated, 42 per cent had an “undetectable level” of the virus for at least four weeks after one injection of antibodies.

此外，实验还涉及来从内地的医疗和研究机构的专家，发现老鼠接受治疗前被HIV感染，在注射了一种抗体后的四周内，42%的老鼠有“检测不到水平”的病毒。

Chen explained that the drug could “kill two birds with one stone” as it could firstly, kill the virus and secondly, if it was already flourishing, prevent it from entering more cells. 

陈志伟解释，药物首先能够“一箭双雕”，其次能杀死病毒，假如病毒已经繁衍，那么可以防止它进入细胞。

这不仅仅是同性恋的问题：香港爱滋病中心主任表明日益增长的HIV患者引起全社会的关注。

Existing therapy for those with the virus involves taking medication daily, otherwise the “level of the virus would rebound”, Chen said.
陈志伟说，对那些感染病毒的人来说，现有的治疗就是每天服药， 否则“病毒水平会反弹”。

There is also Truvada, a pill that can prevent infection. It is a pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, that if taken daily, can lower the chances of getting HIV from sex by over 90 per cent and from injecting drugs by over 70 per cent, according to the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. 

还有特鲁瓦特，一种能够防止感染的药，或者PrEP，那些药假如每天服用，能降低超过90%从性行为中，以及超过70%从注射药物中感染HIV的机会，根据美国疾控中心的调查。

In Hong Kong, the drug is offered through private clinics at a price of about HK$8,000 to HK$10,000 for one month’s supply, according to Aids Concern, an NGO.

在香港，该药由私家诊所提供，价格约8000到10000港币，为期一个月，根据一个非政府组织关怀爱滋协会统计。

Other vaccines and long-acting antiviral drugs are at different stages of testing.

其它药苗和长效抗病毒药物处于不同的测试阶段。

Findings from the HKU study were recently published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Clinical Investigation.

香港大学研究结果最近发表在同行评审的《临床研究杂志》上。
The research team’s goal, Chen said, was to lengthen the period of protection offered by its new antibody drug.

陈志伟说，该研究小组的目标，是延长这种新抗体药的保护期。

Breakthrough HKUST-led research on mapping of HIV weak spots paves way for vaccine

突破了香港科学大学主导的HIV弱毒株定位研究，为疫苗铺平了道路。

“We are doing further modifications ... to make sure the drug concentration can be maintained for much longer time. We are targeting [for this to be] weeks or even months,” said Chen, who is also a professor of microbiology at HKU.

“我们正在做进一步的修改。。。以确定药物的浓度能够维持很多时间。我们的目标是几周甚至是几个月，”陈志伟说道，他也是香港大学微生物学的教授。

Chen added that as long as the drug concentration was “maintained at the effective level”, the team expected it to provide 100 per cent prevention against an infection.

陈志伟补充，只要药物浓度是“保持在有效的水平上”，团队希望能提供100%的预防感染。

The tests found that the drug was effective against 124 strains of HIV, including those that are commonly found in infected people from Hong Kong and mainland China.

测试发现，药物能有效对抗124种爱滋病毒，包括香港和中国大陆中常见的感染人群。

According to government figures, 9,091 people in Hong Kong were diagnosed with HIV between 1984 – when the first case was reported – and last year. About 681 new cases were reported to the Centre for Health Protection last year. The cost of antiretroviral drugs for those in the city infected with the virus comes up to over HK$550 million a year, according to a press release issued by HKU on Thursday.

根据政府的数据，在1984年——第一病例被报导时——到去年在香港有9091名人士被诊断为HIV。根据香港大学在周四发布的新闻稿表明，去年，约681名新案例被卫生防护中心报导。为这座城市感染病毒的人提供的抗转录病毒药物的费用每年高达5.5亿港币。

One major challenge in developing a vaccine to combat HIV – which has infected more than 70 million people and killed about 35 million globally – is how quickly the virus mutates and changes its appearance to evade antibodies that a person’s immune system produces to fight it off.

一个主要的挑战是研制抗爱滋病的疫苗——已经感染了超过7千万人以及令全球3500万人死亡——病毒如何快速变异以及改变其外观以逃避人体免疫系统产生的抗体。
