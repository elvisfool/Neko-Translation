“I CERTAINLY didn’t set out to create a language that was intended for mass consumption,” says Guido van Rossum, a Dutch computer scientist who devised Python, a programming language, in 1989. But nearly three decades on, his invention has overtaken almost all of its rivals and brought coding to the fingertips of people who were once baffled by it. In the past 12 months Americans have searched for Python on Google more often than for Kim Kardashian, a reality-TV star. The number of queries has trebled since 2010, while those for other major programming languages have been flat or declining.

“当然，我不会为了旨在大众的消费而创造一种语言，” 吉多·范罗苏姆，一名在1989年发明了一种名为Python程式语言的荷兰计算机科学家如是说。但在近三十年中，他的发明几乎超越了所有的对手并将它带到了深受编程困扰的人们的手指边上。在过去的12个月中，在谷歌上的Python的搜索量已经超过了电视真人秀明星，金·卡戴姗。从2010起，当其它的主流编程语言呈平缓或下降状态时，Pythonr搜索量达三倍之多。

The language’s two main advantages are its simplicity and flexibility. Its straightforward syntax and use of indented spaces make it easy to learn, read and share. Its avid practitioners, known as Pythonistas, have uploaded 145,000 custom-built software packages to an online repository. These cover everything from game development to astronomy, and can be installed and inserted into a Python program in a matter of seconds. This versatility means that the Central Intelligence Agency has used it for hacking, Google for crawling webpages, Pixar for producing movies and Spotify for recommending songs. Some of the most popular packages harness “machine learning”, by crunching large quantities of data to pick out patterns that would otherwise be imperceptible. 

这门语言有两大优点：简单和灵活。简单的语法和缩进空格的用法使其容易上手学习，理解以及分享。一些狂热分子被称为Python的支持者们，已经上传了145,000个定制的软件包到在线素材库中。覆盖了从游戏开发到天文学以及在几秒中内被安装和插入Python程序中的软件包。用途广泛意味着美国中情局曾利用它进行黑客攻击，谷歌用来抓取网页数据，皮克斯用来制作电影以及Spotify用来给用户推荐音乐。一些很流行的软件包用来进行“机器学习“，通过进行大量数据的处理以识别出其它难以发现的模式。

With such a rapidly growing user base and wide array of capabilities, Python might seem destined to become the lingua franca of coding, rendering all other competitors obsolete. That is unlikely, according to Grady Booch, IBM’s chief software scientist, who compares programming languages to empires. Though at times a rising power might be poised for world domination, its rivals generally survive in the technical and cultural niches in which they emerged. Python will not replace C and C++, which are “lower-level options” that give the user more control over what is going on in a computer’s processor. Nor will it kill off Java, which is popular for building complicated applications, or JavaScript, which powers most web pages.

随着快速增长的用户人数以及其高性能，Python也许能成为编程的通用语言，从而淘汰了其它的竞争对手。这是不太可能的，根据IBM的首席软件科学家格雷迪·布奇的说法，他把编程语言比作帝国。尽管有时崛起的势力也许能统治世界，其竞争对手通常会在技术和文化领域生存下来。Python将不会代替被称为“低层选项”的C和C++,这两种语言让用户对计算机的处理器有更多的选择。也不会代替Java，它是流行的构建复杂应用程序的语言，也不会代替JavaScript,其为大多数的Web页面提供支持。

Moreover, Pythonistas who take their language’s supremacy for granted should beware. Fortran, Lisp and Ada were all highly popular in the 1980s and 1990s, according to the TIOBE index, which tracks coding practices among professional developers. Their use has plummeted, as more efficient options have become available. No empire, regardless of its might, can last forever. 

此外，把这种语言视为权威的Python的支持者应该要注意。根据开发语言排行榜，Fortran, Lisp以Ada在80年代和90年代同样也非常的流行，这个排行榜是用来在专业开发者中跟踪编码实践的。当出现更有效的选项时，这些语言的使用急剧下降。不管是否有这种可能，没有任何一种语言帝国能永恒。

Python has brought computer programming to a vast new audience

And its inventor has just stepped down

Python为计算机编程带来了巨大的新粉丝

发明者刚刚退出江湖

IN DECEMBER 1989 Guido van Rossum, a Dutch computer scientist, set himself a Christmas project. Irked by shortcomings in other programming languages, he wanted to build his own. His principles were simple. First, it should be easy to read. Rather than sprawling over line-endings and being broken up by a tangle of curly braces, each chunk would be surrounded with indented white space. Second, it should let users create their own packages of special-purpose coding modules, which could then be made available to others to form the basis of new programs. Third, he wanted a “short, unique and slightly mysterious” name. He therefore called it after Monty Python, a British comedy group. The package repository became known as the Cheese Shop.

1989年12月的吉多·范罗苏姆，一名荷兰的计算机科学家，给自己设了一个圣诞节计划。由于对其它编程语言缺陷感到不满，他想自己开发一种语言。他原则很简单。首先，它具有易读性。与其让行尾结束符不断扩展以及被一连串括号不停打断，不如让每一个数据块用空格缩进进行分割。其次，能够让使用者建立自己的编码模块数据包，这些数据包能够为其他人的新程序提供基础。第三，他想要一个“简洁独特和稍有神秘感”的名字。他最终以英国六人喜剧团体名字” Monty Python”（巨蟒剧团）为命名。程序包仓库也被称为奶酪店。

Nearly 30 years after his Christmas invention, Mr Van Rossum resembles a technological version of the Monty Python character who accidentally became the Messiah in the film “Life of Brian”. “I certainly didn’t set out to create a language that was intended for mass consumption,” he explains. But in the past 12 months Google users in America have searched for Python more often than for Kim Kardashian, a reality-TV star. The rate of queries has trebled since 2010, while inquiries after other programming languages have been flat or declining (see chart).

在他的圣诞发明后的近30年里，范罗苏姆先生像极了一个技术版本的巨蟒剧团角色，这个角色很偶然地成为了“布莱尔一生”中的弥塞尔。“我当然没打算去创造一种语言是为了大众消费，”他解释说。但是在过去的12个月中，谷歌在美国的用户对Python的搜索量多于真人秀电视明星金·卡戴珊。自2010年起，在其它编程语言的搜索量趋于平缓或者下降的时候，Python的查询率激增三倍。

The language’s popularity has grown not merely among professional developers—nearly 40% of whom use it, with a further 25% wishing to do so, according to Stack Overflow, a programming forum—but also with ordinary folk. Codecademy, a website that has taught 45m novices how to use various languages, says that by far the biggest increase in demand is from those wishing to learn Python. It is thus bringing coding to the fingertips of those once baffled by the subject. Pythonistas, as aficionados are known, have helped by adding more than 145,000 packages to the Cheese Shop, covering everything from astronomy to game development.

这种语言使用增长不仅在专业开发者中颇为流行——他们当中有将40%的人在使用它，同时还有25%的人打算使用它，根据编程论坛Stack Overflow的调查——而且在普通用户中也是如此。一个教授四千五百万新手学习不同语言的网站Codecademy声称，目前为止需求增幅最大的是想学习Python的人。因此，他们把这一语言带到了曾受编程困扰的人的手指边上。Python的支持者，众所周知的狂热份子，已经提供了超过145,000个软件包给奶酪店，覆盖了从天文学到游戏开发的所有领域。

Mr Van Rossum, though delighted by this enthusiasm for his software, has come to find the rigours of supervising it, in his role as “benevolent dictator for life”, unbearable. He fears he has become something of an idol. “I’m uncomfortable with that fame,” he says, sounding uncannily like Brian trying to drive away the crowds of disciples. “Sometimes I feel like everything I say or do is seen as a very powerful force.” On July 12th he resigned, leaving the Pythonistas to manage themselves.

范罗苏姆先生尽管对有人对这个软件狂热而到感兴，但是也发现了软件监管的严格性，他难以忍受作为“终身仁慈独裁者”的角色。他担心他会成为偶像。“我对于名气非常不适应，”他表示，听起来很奇怪就像布莱尔试着驱赶那些门徒一样。“有时候感觉我的说的或者做的都被当作一种非常强大的力量。”在7月12日，他辞职了，离开了Python的支持者，让他们自己管理自己。

Python is not perfect. Other languages have more processing efficiency and specialised capabilities. C and C++ are “lower-level” options which give the user more control over what is happening within a computer’s processor. Java is popular for building large, complex applications. JavaScript is the language of choice for applications accessed via a web browser. Countless others have evolved for various purposes. But Python’s killer features—simple syntax that makes its code easy to learn and share, and its huge array of third-party packages—make it a good general-purpose language. Its versatility is shown by its range of users and uses. The Central Intelligence Agency has employed it for hacking, Pixar for producing films, Google for crawling web pages and Spotify for recommending songs. 

Python并非完美。其它语言也有更多的处理效率和专业能力。C 和C++能给予用户更多对计算机处理器更多控制权的“低层”选项。Java通常用于建立一个大型复杂的应用程序, JavaScript对于通过网页浏览器进行应用程序的访问来说是首选语言。其它无数的语言也为了不同的目的而进化。但Python有它的杀手锏——语法简单使得其代码容易上手和分享，同时着强大的第三方数据包——使其成为一个良好的通用语言。其多功能性表现为用户和使用范围。美国中情局用它来进行黑客攻击，皮克斯公司用来制作电影，谷歌用来抓取网页数据以及Spotify用来给用户推荐音乐。

Some of the most alluring packages that Pythonistas can find in the Cheese Shop harness artificial intelligence (AI). Users can create neural networks, which mimic the connections in a brain, to pick out patterns in large quantities of data. Mr Van Rossum says that Python has become the language of choice for AI researchers, who have produced numerous packages for it. 

Python支持者们利用人工智能在奶酪店里找到了一些最有吸引力的程序包。用户们能建立神经网络，模仿大脑的连接，在大数据中挑选出一些模式。范罗苏姆先生表示，Python已经成人工智能研究者的首选，这些研究者们已经为其提供了大量的程序包。

Not all Pythonistas are so ambitious, though. Zach Sims, Codecademy’s boss, believes many visitors to his website are attempting to acquire skills that could help them in what are conventionally seen as “non-technical” jobs. Marketers, for instance, can use the language to build statistical models that measure the effectiveness of campaigns. College lecturers can check whether they are distributing grades properly. (Even journalists on The Economist, scraping the web for data, generally use programs written in Python to do so.) 

虽然，并不是所有的Python支持者们都如此雄心勃勃。Codecademy的老板扎克·西姆斯相信，许多浏览他网页的人只想获取技能，这些技能能帮助他们完成传统上被称为“非技术”的工作。比如营销商，能够使用语言建立一个统计模型以衡量有效的营销活动。大学讲师能够检查他们是否评分是否合理。（甚至一些经济学人的记者，抓取网页数据，通过使用编写Python来实现这一目的。）

For professions that have long relied on trawling through spreadsheets, Python is especially valuable. Citigroup, an American bank, has introduced a crash course in Python for its trainee analysts. A jobs website, eFinancialCareers, reports a near-fourfold increase in listings mentioning Python between the first quarters of 2015 and 2018.

对于长期依赖Excel表格进行工作的职业者来说，Python是非常有价值的。美国的花旗银行已经为实习分析师引入了Python的速成课。就业网站eFinancialCareers，报告在2015年到2018年间，提及Python的列表增长了四倍。

The thirst for these skills is not without risk. Cesar Brea, a partner at Bain & Company, a consultancy, warns that the scariest thing in his trade is “someone who has learned a tool but doesn’t know what is going on under the hood”. Without proper oversight, a novice playing with AI libraries could reach dodgy conclusions. Bernd Ziegler, a partner at Boston Consulting Group, says that his firm reserves such analysis to members of its data team. 

这些技能的需求并非没有风险。贝恩公司合伙人和顾问，塞萨尔·布雷警告说，在他的生意中最令人恐惧的是，“有人学习了工具，但是不知道怎么回事。” 没有适当的监管，新手们使用人工智能库就能得到一些不靠谱的结论。波士顿咨询公司的合伙人贝恩德•齐格勒表示，他的公司将这些分析保留给数据团队的成员。

Rossum’s universal robot

罗苏姆的通用机器人

One solution to the problem of semi-educated tinkerers is to educate them properly in the language’s arcana. Python was already the most popular introductory language at American universities in 2014, but the teaching of it is generally limited to those studying science, technology, engineering and mathematics. A more radical proposal is to catch ’em young by offering computer science to all, and in primary schools. Hadi Partovi, the boss of Code.org, a charity, notes that 40% of American schools now offer such lessons, up from 10% in 2013. Around two-thirds of 10- to 12-year-olds have an account on Code.org’s website. Perhaps unnerved by a future filled with automated jobs, 90% of American parents want their children to study computer science.

解决半文盲的其中一个解决方法就是用语言的艺术正确地教育他们。Python在2014年美国大学里已经成为最流行的入门语言。但其教学也仅仅限于那些学习科学，技术，工程和数学的学生。一个更激进的建议是为所有的年轻人提供计算机科学课程。一个慈善团体Code.org的老板哈迪•帕尔托维，提到有40%的美国学校现在提供这样的课程，在2013年这一比例为10%。约有三分之二的介于10-12岁的孩子有Code.org的帐户。也许未来自动化工作会带来不安，但是仍有90%的美国家长希望他们的孩子学习计算机科学。

How much longer Python’s rise will continue is anybody’s guess. There have been dominant computer languages in the past that, while not exactly “one with Nineveh and Tyre”, now skulk in the background. In the 1960s, Fortran bestrode the world. As teaching languages for neophytes, both Basic and Pascal had their moments in the sun. And Mr Partovi himself plumped for JavaScript as the language for Code.org’s core syllabus, since it remains the standard choice for animating web pages.

很多人猜想Python的人气还会持续多久。在过去，计算机语言占主导地位，虽然不完全“重要”，现在则隐藏在后台运作。在60年代，Fortran主宰了整个世界。为新手的教学语言，Basic和Pascal也曾有过辉煌的时刻。帕尔托维先生自己也支持JavaScript作为Code.org的核心教学大纲，因为它仍是动画网页的标准选择。
注：One with Nineveh and Tyre是出于自英国的诗人Joseph Rudyard Kipling在1897年写给当时维多利亚女皇钻婚的一首命为”Recessional“的一首诗里的一句。里面Nineveh指的是现在伊拉克克摩苏尔，当时是首都；而Tyre指的是黎巴嫩南部地区的一个首府，一个重要的港口城市。这句话的意思是指非常重要。

No computing language can ever be truly general purpose. Specialisation will necessarily remain important. It is nevertheless true that, in that long-past Yuletide, Mr Van Rossum started something memorable. He isn’t the Messiah, but he was a very clever boy.

没有那种计算机语言是真正意义上的通用型。专业化将会变得非常重要。然而事实上，在遥远的那个圣诞节里，范罗苏姆先生创造了一些值得纪念的东西，他不是弥塞尔，他是一个非常聪明的男孩。

The text
God of our fathers, known of old,
  Lord of our far-flung battle line,
Beneath whose awful hand we hold
  Dominion over palm and pine—
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget—lest we forget!

The tumult and the shouting dies;
  The Captains and the Kings depart:
Still stands Thine ancient sacrifice,
  An humble and a contrite heart.
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget—lest we forget!

Far-called our navies melt away;
  On dune and headland sinks the fire:
Lo, all our pomp of yesterday
  Is one with Nineveh and Tyre!
Judge of the Nations, spare us yet,
Lest we forget—lest we forget!

If, drunk with sight of power, we loose
  Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe,
Such boastings as the Gentiles use,
  Or lesser breeds without the Law—
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget—lest we forget!

For heathen heart that puts her trust
  In reeking tube and iron shard,
All valiant dust that builds on dust,
  And guarding calls not Thee to guard,
For frantic boast and foolish word—
Thy Mercy on Thy People, Lord!
