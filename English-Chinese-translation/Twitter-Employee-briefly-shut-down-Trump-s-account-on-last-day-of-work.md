Twitter: Employee briefly shut down Trump's account on last day of work

推特：职员在职最后一天关闭了川普的账号

（CNNMoney)On Thursday night around 7 p.m. ET, the unthinkable happened: The Tweeter-in-Chief disappeared from his beloved platform.
（CNN财经）在周二晚上约7点，不可思议的事情发生了：推特天王在他最爱的社交平台上消失了。

President Trump's verified @realDonaldTrump account briefly went offline. Anyone who navigated to his feed was given a generic blue landing page that read, "Sorry, that page doesn't exist!"

被川普总统认证的@realDonaldTrump 账号短暂离线了。关注他的粉丝们看到一个蓝色的登录页面，上面写着"抱歉，该页面不存在！"
接着情况发生了逆转，大家意识到这不是技术故障——只是推特员工在他或她在职最后一天的所为。

Initially, one of the social media site's verified accounts said Trump's feed was "inadvertently deactivated due to a human error." But a couple of hours later, Twitter announced further investigation revealed "a Twitter customer support employee ... did this on the employee's last day."

首先，其中一个被认证的社交媒体说，川普的推特是"由于人为的错误导致了意外的停用。"但几个小时后，推特宣布进一步调查显示"一名推特公司的客户支持部门的员工。。。干的，在其工作的最后一天。

Trump tweeted Friday morning, "I guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact."The company said it's conducting "a full internal review" of the incident.

川普在周五发表推文时称，“我猜这个词最终流行并产生影响。”推特公司称会对事件进行“全面的内部调查”。

Trump's account was restored within minutes -- 11 to be exact.
川普的帐号在几分钟内被恢复了——确切来说是11分钟。

But Twitter lit up with speculation, conspiracy theories, and plenty of sarcastic jokes about Trump's brief exodus.

但是推特因为川普的短暂离线引起了猜测、阴谋论和一些挖苦式的笑话。

"In that moment, 'Sorry, that page doesn't exist!' [Trump] truly became President," one user wrote.
"That was like .003 Scaramuccis," wrote another user, referring to the president's short-lived communications director.

一名网友这样写，”在这一刻，‘抱歉，该页面不存在！’他真的做了总统，”
“就好像千分之三的斯卡拉穆奇，”有其他人这样写，指的是总统短命的白宫通讯主任。

"If Trump's Twitter is down, does this technically mean he's no longer POTUS? I mean, it's the only part of the job he pays attention to," another said.

有其他网友这样写，“假如川普的帐号关闭了，在技术层面来说他不再是总统了？我是说，这只是他所关注的工作的一部分。”

Some users, like New Republic editor Jeet Heer, mocked the furor. One tweet from Heer read, "Wait, Trump's twitter account has disappeared. Is this how we do coups now?"

一些用户，像《新共和国周刊》的编辑吉特·希尔，疯狂地嘲笑川普，他其中一些推文，“稍等，川普的帐号没了，现在我们怎么发动政变？”

Others speculated about whether Twitter barred Trump from the platform. News that it was a Twitter worker behind the @realDonaldTrump shutout ignited a new flurry of tweets. Perhaps one of the most defining elements of his presidency, Trump's Twitter use consistently makes headlines.

其它一些猜测是推特是否禁止川普使用该社交平台。有消息称，在@realDonaldTrump 这个帐号背后工作的员工引发了一系列新的讨论。川普频繁地发布推文成为头条也许是他任期内最重要的事情之一。

Trump often uses the platform to levy attacks publicly. Those on the receiving end of his tweets include Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill who he views as roadblocks to his policy initiatives. The press has often been the subject of vitriolic tweets. And NFL players who kneel during the anthem to protest racial injustice have been targets of @realDonaldTrump.

川普经常使用该平台公开地攻击他人。那些被他推文提到的是包括国会山的“民主党人和共和党人”，川普认为这是他推行政策的绊脚石。传媒也常常成为他发布嘲讽推文的对象。国家橄榄球联盟在奏国歌时半蹲，抗议种族歧视事件就成为@realDonaldTrump 攻击的目标。

Perhaps most notably, however, Trump has also used Twitter to lash out at North Korea, the rogue Asian nation that claims to have a newly bolstered nuclear arsenal.

相关阅读：研究表明，川普的推文是导致负面新闻的标志。也许最为出名的就是川普经常使用推特猛烈抨击北韩，声称拥有最新核武库的无赖式亚洲国家。

"Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer!" Trump tweeted in September, using his choice nickname for North Korea leader Kim Jong Un. The North Korean government claimed the tweet constituted a declaration of war.

“听说北韩的外交部在联合国发言。假如他反馈火箭人的想法，他们的下场好不到哪儿去！”川普在九月发布推文，对北韩领导人金正恩起了个外号。北韩政府声称这条推文意味着宣战。

Many called for Trump to be booted from the platform, arguing his tweets -- which often seem to be typed out on a whim -- could plunge America into a nuclear war.

许多人呼吁川普在社交平台上要学会引导，对其推文的争论——似乎是一时兴起的冲动——会让美国陷入到核战当中。

But Twitter declined to bar Trump's account, saying it must weigh the newsworthiness of Trump's tweets with its violent rhetoric.但Twitter has had issues with high-profile accounts disappearing before. The company's CEO, Jack Dorsey, had his account suspended accidentally in November 2016. Once it came back online, Dorsey tweeted that the suspension was the result of "an internal mistake."

推特公司拒绝封川普的号，表明必须权衡川普具有语言暴力的推文的新闻价值。推特之前也出现过著号帐号消失事件。公司的首席执行官司，杰·多尔西在2016年11月份帐号突然暂停使用。不久后便恢复正常，多尔西发布推主文解释，是由于“内部原因“造成的。
