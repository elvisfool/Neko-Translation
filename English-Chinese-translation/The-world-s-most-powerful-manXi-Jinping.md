世界最有权力的人，习进平比川普有更多的影响力。世界应该要警惕。
也许不要期待习进平改变中国或者世界会更好

The world’s most powerful manXi Jinping has more clout than Donald Trump. The world should be wary
Do not expect Mr Xi to change China, or the world, for the better
AMERICAN presidents have a habit of describing their Chinese counterparts in terms of awe. A fawning Richard Nixon said to Mao Zedong that the chairman’s writings had “changed the world”. To Jimmy Carter, Deng Xiaoping was a string of flattering adjectives: “smart, tough, intelligent, frank, courageous, personable, self-assured, friendly”. Bill Clinton described China’s then president, Jiang Zemin, as a “visionary” and “a man of extraordinary intellect”. Donald Trump is no less wowed. The Washington Post quotes him as saying that China’s current leader, Xi Jinping, is “probably the most powerful” China has had in a century.

美国总统们习惯用敬畏的态度来描述他们的中国盟友。卑躬屈膝的理查德·尼克松告诉毛泽东，主席的著作"改变了全世界"。吉米·卡特对邓小平用了一连串的奉承的形容词："聪明的，强硬的，有智慧的，坦诚的，有勇气的，有品德的，有自信的，友好的"。比尔·克林顿形容当时的中国主席江泽民为"有远见的"和"一个有非凡智慧的人"。唐纳·川普也不逊色。《华盛顿邮报》引用他的话，说中国现任主席习近平可能是一个世纪里中国"最有权力"的人。

Mr Trump may be right. And were it not political suicide for an American president to say so, he might plausibly have added: “Xi Jinping is the world’s most powerful leader.” To be sure, China’s economy is still second in size to America’s and its army, though rapidly gaining muscle, pales in comparison. But economic heft and military hardware are not everything. The leader of the free world has a narrow, transactional approach to foreigners and seems unable to enact his agenda at home. The United States is still the world’s most powerful country, but its leader is weaker at home and less effective abroad than any of his recent predecessors, not least because he scorns the values and alliances that underpin American influence.

川普先生也许是对的。如果对于一位美国总统来说不是政治自杀的话，他似乎应该加上那么一句：“习进平是世界上最有权力的领导人。”当然了，中国的经济规模仍然是位于美国经济和军队实力之后，位居第二，尽管快速发展，但相形见绌。经济实力和军队硬件并不代表一切。自由世界的领导者，外交上有一种准确的处理事务方式以及在国内理应不能推行他的计划。美国仍然是世界上最强大的国家，但他们的领导人在国内不是强势者，比他的前任在海外的影响力都要少，尤其因为他蔑视了支持美国影响力的价值观和同盟。

The president of the world’s largest authoritarian state, by contrast, walks with swagger abroad. His grip on China is tighter than any leader’s since Mao. And whereas Mao’s China was chaotic and miserably poor, Mr Xi’s is a dominant engine of global growth. His clout will soon be on full display. On October 18th China’s ruling Communist Party will convene a five-yearly congress in Beijing (see Briefing). It will be the first one presided over by Mr Xi. Its 2,300 delegates will sing his praises to the skies. More sceptical observers might ask whether Mr Xi will use his extraordinary power for good or ill.

世界上最大集权国家的主席，相比之下，在海外趾高气昂。从毛泽东时代起，他对中国的管控胜于历任领导人。然而毛泽东时代的中国是无序并且贫穷，习进平时代则是全球经济的主要引擎。他的影响力很快会得到呈现。在10月18日中国共产党在北京召开五年一次的会议。这将是习进平第一次主持会议。2300名代表将会歌颂他。更多持怀疑态度的观察家也许会问，习进平是否会将他手中巨大的权力运用得当。

World, take note
世界，小心

On his numerous foreign tours, Mr Xi presents himself as an apostle of peace and friendship, a voice of reason in a confused and troubled world. Mr Trump’s failings have made this much easier. At Davos in January Mr Xi promised the global elite that he would be a champion of globalisation, free trade and the Paris accord on climate change. Members of his audience were delighted and relieved. At least, they thought, one great power was willing to stand up for what was right, even if Mr Trump (then president-elect) would not.

在他多次的海外出访问中，习进平主席将自己视为和平和友谊的信徒，在这个纷繁杂乱的世界里，发出理性之声。川普的外交失败让这一切变得更容易。在1月份的达沃斯大会上，习进平承诺与会者，他将会是全球化，自由贸易和巴黎气候协议的拥护者。他的听众们都很高兴，也松了一口气。至少他们以为，即使川普不会这么干(当时还在竞选总统)。一个大国会愿意支持正义。 

Mr Xi’s words are heeded partly because he has the world’s largest stockpile of foreign currency to back them up. His “Belt and Road Initiative” may be puzzlingly named, but its message is clear—hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese money are to be invested abroad in railways, ports, power stations and other infrastructure that will help vast swathes of the world to prosper. That is the kind of leadership America has not shown since the post-war days of the Marshall Plan in western Europe (which was considerably smaller).

习进平的讲话受到重视，部分原因是中国拥有世界上最多的外汇储备来支持他们的计划。“一带一路”的命名也许让人摸不着头脑，但是其信息是很清晰的——数亿美元的中国资金会投资到海外，在铁路，港口，电站和其它基础设施建设，这一切都有助于世界其它地方的繁荣。自从战后西欧（相当小的区域）的马歇尔计划以后，美国没有展现出这种领导力。

Mr Xi is also projecting what for China is unprecedented military power abroad. This year he opened the country’s first foreign military base, in Djibouti. He has sent the Chinese navy on manoeuvres ever farther afield, including in July on NATO’s doorstep in the Baltic Sea alongside Russia’s fleet. China says it would never invade other countries to impose its will (apart from Taiwan, which it does not consider a country). Its base-building efforts are to support peacekeeping, anti-piracy and humanitarian missions, it says. As for the artificial islands with military-grade runways it is building in the South China Sea, these are purely defensive.

习进平也在筹划中国前所未有的海外军事力量。今年，他在吉布提开设第一个海外军事基地。他派遣中国的海军到更远的地方进行军事演业，包括7月与俄罗斯舰队在北约附近的波罗的海的演习。中国声称决不会侵略他国并强加本国意志（除了台湾，它不被承认是一个国家）。并且，基地的作用是为了支持维和，反海盗和人道主义援助。对于在中国南海人工岛上的军用飞机跑道，中方认为只是纯粹的防御。

Unlike Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, Mr Xi is not a global troublemaker who seeks to subvert democracy and destabilise the West. Still, he is too tolerant of troublemaking by his nuke-brandishing ally, North Korea (see Schumpeter). And some of China’s military behaviour alarms its neighbours, not only in South-East Asia but also in India and Japan.

不像俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京，习进平并不是那些颠覆民族和破坏西方，给全球带来麻烦的人。他仍然忍受了炫耀核弹的同盟，北韩。同时中国军队的某些行为引起了领国的警觉，不仅在东南亚，而且还在印度和日本。

At home, Mr Xi’s instincts are at least as illiberal as those of his Russian counterpart. He believes that even a little political permissiveness could prove not only his own undoing, but that of his regime. The fate of the Soviet Union haunts him, and that insecurity has consequences. He mistrusts not only the enemies his purges have created but also China’s fast-growing, smartphone-wielding middle class, and the shoots of civil society that were sprouting when he took over. He seems determined to tighten control over Chinese society, not least by enhancing the state’s powers of surveillance, and to keep the commanding heights of the economy firmly under the party’s thumb. All this will make China less rich than it should be, and a more stifling place to live. Human-rights abuses have grown worse under Mr Xi, with barely a murmur of complaint from other world leaders.

在内政事务上，习进平的天性至少和他的俄罗斯同盟一样的专制。他相信在政治上的稍加放纵，就能毁灭不仅是他自己而且是整个政权。前苏联的命运一直困扰着他，而且不安全感一直影响着他。他不信任那些不仅通过政治清洗造成的敌人，而且还包括快速增长，使用智能手机的中产以及他掌权时，正在出现的社会公民的萌芽。他似乎加紧了对中国社会的管控，尤其是加强了国家权力的监督，以及在党的领导下牢牢把握了经济的制高点。所有这一切都会令中国的经济衰退和死气沉沉。在习进平的领导下，人权状况变得糟糕，在别国领导人那里听不到异见。

Liberals once mourned the “ten lost years” of reform under Mr Xi’s predecessor, Hu Jintao. Those ten years have become 15, and may exceed 20. Some optimists argue that we have not yet seen the real Mr Xi—that the congress will help him consolidate his power, and after that he will begin social and economic reforms in earnest, building on his relative success in curbing corruption. If he is a closet pluralist, however, he disguises it well. And alarmingly for those who believe that all leaders have a sell-by date, Mr Xi is thought to be reluctant to step down in 2022, when precedent suggests he should.

在习进平的前任胡锦涛的领导下，自由主义者们一度为改革的“十年”感到惋惜。那些十年也许变成15年，或者超过20年。一些乐观派争辩说，我们还没有见识真正的习进平——十九大将会有助于他巩固权力，并且之后会认真地开展社会和经济的改革，以他在反腐方面取得的成绩为基础。如果他是一位多元主义的支持者，那么，他伪装得太好了。同时，令人担忧的是那些相信所有领导人都会按时退位的人，当他的前任提醒他该这么做的时候，习进平似乎并不会在2022年退位。

Reasons to be fearful
恐惧的原因

Mr Xi may think that concentrating more or less unchecked power over 1.4bn Chinese in the hands of one man is, to borrow one of his favourite terms, the “new normal” of Chinese politics. But it is not normal; it is dangerous. No one should have that much power. One-man rule is ultimately a recipe for instability in China, as it has been in the past—think of Mao and his Cultural Revolution. It is also a recipe for arbitrary behaviour abroad, which is especially worrying at a time when Mr Trump’s America is pulling back and creating a power vacuum. The world does not want an isolationist United States or a dictatorship in China. Alas, it may get both.

习进平可能会认为，通过14亿中国人掌握或多或少不受控制的力量正是——借用他最喜欢的一组词——中国政治的“新常态”。但这都不是正常的；这是非常危险的状态。没有人应该拥有这么多权力。专制统治导致中国陷入巨大的不稳定中，就像过去发生的那样——毛泽东思想和文化大革命。这也会导致海外行动的专制，令人担忧的是川普的美国政府正在撤出全球并建立了一个权力真空。世界并不想要一个孤立主义的美国和独裁的中国，唉，也许两者兼而有之。
