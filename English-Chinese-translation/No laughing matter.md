For the Communist Party, this could be a risk

The picture now is less rosy. On April 9th state media reported that Chinese regulators had suspended Byte dance’s flagship app, Jinri Toutiao (Today’s Headlines) for three weeks. They had also banned outright another of its products, a joke-sharing app called Neihan Duanzi, which specialised in bawdy humour and had more than 20m active users. Officials said its “vulgar and banal” content had upset people. Two days later Zhang Yiming, the firm’s founder, issued an apology online saying he was “filled with guilt and remorse” that his apps had taken “the wrong path”. He said his company had not understood that “technology must be led by socialist core values.” He pledged that it would do more to spread “positive energy”.

情况已经不那么乐观了。四月九日中国国家媒体报道了中国监管机构暂缓了字节跳动公司的旗舰应用程式——今日头条——已经三周了。他们还彻底地下架了公司的另一款产品，一款分享笑话的，名为内涵段子的应用，这款应用专门分享下流笑话，有200万的活跃用户。官方认为这些“格调低俗”的内容让人感到不适。两天后，张一鸣，公司的创始人，在网上发布了道歉信，声称让该应用走在错误的道路上感到“内疚和懊悔”。他说公司没能对“社会主义核心价值观引领技术”有很好的理解，并承诺将会对传播“正能量”做更多的工作。

Bytedance’s travails, and those of three other firms that also had to suspend their news-aggregating apps, suggest that censors are trying to catch up with new technology. Officials appear to worry that people can immerse themselves in news and entertainment which, while posing no direct challenge to the party, fail to promote party views. Personalised news services using artificial intelligence have enabled users to wall themselves off from puff pieces about the party’s latest achievements. (Jinri Toutiao’s slogan, featured in the advertisement pictured above, promises readers “only what you care about”.) David Bandurski of the China Media Project, a research group in Hong Kong, says that “party leaders are aware of this.” This is why Mr Zhang now promises to do a better job of promoting “authoritative media” through his services.

字节跳动公司面临的阵痛以及其它三家公司也不得不暂缓使用其新闻应用的事件，表明中国政府的审查正试图赶上新技术的发展。官方担心大家会把自己沉浸在新闻和娱乐当中，虽然对党没有产生挑战，但是却未能促进对党的观点的附和。使用人工智能的个性化新闻服务让用户摆脱了对党的工作最新成果的关注。（“今日头条”的标语，在如上图所示的广告中具有某种特色，对读者承诺“你关心的，才是头条”。）中国传媒研究计划——在香港的一个研究小组——的班志远， 表示“党的邻导人意识到了这一点”。这就是为什么张一鸣现在承诺要通过其服务更好推广“权威媒体”。

Censors are also paying more attention to content they regard as “lowbrow”: material deemed licentious, sexist or likely to encourage what the party regards as immoral behaviour. State media have reported disapprovingly on the uploading of videos to one of Bytedance’s platforms by teenage mothers who do not appear contrite about having children before the legal age for marriage. Cultural commissars are becoming quicker to suppress anything they regard as non-mainstream, from hip-hop music to tattoos. The national football team recently took to the field with their ink hidden under bandages.

审查者也会更多地关注他们认为是“低俗”的内容: 素材被认为是下流，性别歧视以及有可能鼓励一些党认为是道德败坏的行为。那些还没达到法定结婚年龄的少龄母亲，把视频上传到字节跳动公司的其中一个平台时，并不表现出懊悔，官方媒体对此表示不满。

In the past ten months officials have also been clamping down on gossip. Some portals have replaced their feeds offering news about celebrities with alternatives directing users to patriotic fare. Regulators have also shut down the microblog accounts of celebrity-gossip writers. The censors’ reasoning may be that tattle about film stars might lead people to believe that it is also acceptable to peddle rumour about politicians. Or they may have simply decided that reading such news diverts people’s attention from the latest utterances of President Xi Jinping.


在过去的十个月中，官方也压制了一些流言。一些门户网站用名人新闻取代了他们的新闻频道，有了将用户引向爱国路线的替代方案。监管机构也关闭了一些名人八卦作家的微博帐户。审查的理由也许是一些关于电影明星的闲聊，可能也令人们相信对政客们散播谣言也是可以接受的。或者他们简单地觉得阅读这类新闻能转移人 们对近来习近平言论的一些注意力。

Xi’s amazing
令人惊讶的吹捧

Efforts to boost Mr Xi are reaching unprecedented heights. Pictures of him are commanding increasing amounts of space on the front pages of official newspapers. Last month a film called “Amazing China” became the country’s highest-ever grossing documentary, in large part because government offices and state-linked companies have been encouraged to block-book screenings for their staff. The film dwells on the achievements of Mr Xi. In February the media regulator said that it would designate 5,000 cinemas as “People’s Theatres”. These will have to devote more time to films such as “Amazing China” that promote socialist values. 

努力推动习近平思想达到了前所未有的高度。他的照片在官方报纸的头版中占据了越来越多的版面。上月一部名为“厉害了，我的国”的电影成为这个国家有史以来最高票房的记录片，很大程度上是因为国家机关和国有公司要求他们的员工对该影片进行整片承包。这部影片讲述了习近平的成就。在二月，媒体监管机构声称要把500座电影院设为“人民影院”。这将不得不投入更多的时间在诸如“厉害了，我的国”这样电影上以促进社会主义核心价值观的实现。

The censors’ shifting priorities are a challenge for Chinese tech firms. Companies that operate social-media platforms or allow users to share content have their own in-house censors. In his online apology, Mr Zhang of Bytedance said he planned to expand his team of them by two-thirds, to 10,000. But such employees are often unsure how to interpret the government’s directives. Last year the New York Times reported that regulators had circulated a less-than-helpful list of 68 types of material that internet firms were expected to expunge, ranging from media that promote “unhealthy marital values” to posts that blur lines between “beauty and ugliness”. 

对于中国的技术公司而言，转移审查重点是一个挑战。经营社交媒体平台或允许用户分享内容的公司有着自己内部的审查机构。字节跳动的张一鸣在网络道歉信上称，他计划增大团队人数至一万人。但是这些员工往往不知道如何解读政府的指令。去年《纽约时报》报道，监管机构发布了一份意义不大的68种材料的清单，要求互联网公司能够删除清单中的内容，范围从宣传“不健康婚姻价值观”到发布“美和丑”之间界限模糊的贴子。
	
Satisfying the censors also involves financial risk. Bytedance and similar companies will find it much more difficult to attract and retain users without content that is “borderline risqué”, says Bhavtosh Vajpayee of Bernstein, a research firm. Officials’ distaste for news packaged by algorithm could impede China’s development of artificial intelligence, since news aggregators such as Toutiao offer a profitable means of improving such technology. 

满足审查要求也涉及到财务风险。一家调查公司，巴夫托什·瓦杰帕伊的伯恩斯坦表示字节跳动和类似的公司发现要吸引和留存用户更困难了，如果没有一些“打擦边球的”的内容的话。官员们不喜欢通过算法包装新闻可能会阻碍中国人工智能的发展，因为像“土豆”网这样的新闻平台能提供有利可图的手段来改进这种技术。

Above all, the party itself is taking a risk. In the decade or two before Mr Xi took over, people were given wider leeway to amuse themselves as they wished as long as they avoided politics. Officials may have reckoned that such an approach would reinforce stability by giving people less reason to resent the party. Mr Xi, by contrast, is trying to revive the party as an enforcer of morality and taste. By stamping on citizens’ small pleasures he could irritate many people who had previously shown no interest in politics. 

首先，政党本身也在冒险。在习近平上台的前一二十年里，政府赋予了人们很大的空间去自娱自乐，只要他们避谈政治。官员们可能认为，通过这样的方法能使人们有更少的理由对政府发泄不满，从而对社会保持稳定。相比之下，习近平正试图把对党的复兴作为一个道德和品位的执行者。通过践踏公民权利获得的小小快感，他能激怒更多以前对政治冷感的人。

The biggest fans of Bytedance’s now-defunct humour app, for example, were men without great prospects living in smaller cities. That the app helped them form groups of like-minded individuals in the real world and engage in pranks such as honking their car horns in a coded sequence may help explain why the authorities shut it down. But by trying to insert more propaganda into such people’s leisure time, officials could end up making the party seem like a bore who doesn’t know when to shut up.

字节跳动现在已经下架的应用的最大粉丝们，比如，一个生活在小城市里没有太多人生前景的男人。应用能够帮助他们在现实世界的群组中找到志趣相投的人以及搞一些剧恶作，像是按顺序来按汽车喇叭，这些事情能更好地理解为什么政府要关闭这些应用。但是通过在人们的休闲生活中插入更多的宣传标语，官员们最终使得政党看起来像一个不知道什么时候会闭嘴的讨厌鬼。

In recent weeks, among the country’s more than 700m internet users, there has been evidence of unhappiness with the party’s meddling. On April 13th Sina Weibo, one of the country’s biggest social-media platforms, declared a three-month effort to purge itself of posts containing pornography or promoting violence or homosexuality—topics that had been ruled off-limits by the regulator. It is possible that Sina decided to mount its campaign in a highly public manner in order to show off its zeal to the party’s media watchdogs.

近几周来，该国有超过700万人互联网用户对政府的干预表示了不满。在四月十三号的新浪微博上——该国最大的社交平台之一——宣布进行为期三个月的网络净化行动，包括发布色情文学或者暴力以及同性恋内容的博文，这些话题已经被监管当局禁止发布。新浪可能以高调的方式宣布打响这场战役，以表明对政党进行媒体监督的支持。

Angry people flooded the site with messages lambasting the firm’s intolerance of homosexuality. Even the People’s Daily, a party mouthpiece, weighed in against Sina. On April 16th the company said it would no longer target gay content that was not smutty. The incident marked a rare victory for online freedom and for gay rights. It was also a reminder of how contentious and how unpredictable China’s expanding censorship has become.

愤怒的网民涌入网站，留言指责该平台不包容同性恋行为。甚至《人民日报》，作为党的喉舌，也抨击了新浪网。在四月十六日，该公司声称，不会再针对那些关于并不肮脏的同性恋内容的话题。该事件标志着网络自由和同性恋权利的一场罕有的胜利。这也提醒了人们，中国正在扩大的审查制度——无论多么有争议以及不可预测——已经成为现实。
