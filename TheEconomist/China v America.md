China v America

中美之争

The end of engagement

蜜月期结束

How the world’s two superpowers have become rivals

全球最强两大势力如何成为竞争对手？

version | Leaders Oct 18th 2018

FOR THE past quarter century America’s approach to China has been founded on a belief in convergence. Political and economic integration would not just make China wealthier, they would also make it more liberal, pluralistic and democratic. There were crises, such as a face-off in the Taiwan Strait in 1996 or the downing of a spy-plane in 2001. But America cleaved to the conviction that, with the right incentives, China would eventually join the world order as a “responsible stakeholder”.

在过去的25年，美国对中国的态度已经建立在相互融合的信念之上。政治经济一体化并没有中国更富有，他们理应变得更自由、多元以及民主。然而危机时有发生，比如1996年的台海危机以及 2001年一架间谍飞机被击落。

Today convergence is dead.

而今，妥协已经失效。

America has come to see China as a strategic rival—a malevolent actor and a rule-breaker (see Briefing). The Trump administration accuses it of interfering in America’s culture and politics, of stealing intellectual property and trading unfairly, and of seeking not just leadership in Asia, but also global dominance. It condemns China’s record on human rights at home and an aggressive expansion abroad. This month Mike Pence, the vice-president, warned that China was engaged in a “whole-of-government” offensive. His speech sounded ominously like an early bugle-call in a new cold war.

美国已经看到中国作为一个战略竞争对手——是个狠角色和秩序破坏者。美国政府指控中国干预美国文化和政治，盗窃知识产权，导致不公平贸易以及不仅在亚洲寻求成为领头羊，而且还意图主宰全球。谴责中国在国内的人权状况以及在海外的侵略性扩张。在本月，副总统彭斯警告中国开展了"全政府式"的攻击，他的演讲听起来就像新冷战前恶兆般的号角。

Do not presume that Mr Pence and his boss, President Donald Trump, are alone. Democrats and Republicans are vying to outdo each other in bashing China. Not since the late 1940s has the mood among American businessfolk, diplomats and the armed forces swung so rapidly behind the idea that the United States faces a new ideological and strategic rival.

不要以为彭斯和特朗普是孤军作战。民主党和共和党在抨击中国的问题上正相互较劲。从20世纪40年代开始，在美国面临一个新的意志形态和战略对手的想法背后，美国商界、外交以及军队从未出现过这样波动的情绪。

At the same time, China is undergoing its own change of heart. Chinese strategists have long suspected that America has secretly wanted to block their country’s rise. That is partly why China sought to minimise confrontation by “hiding its strengths and biding its time”. For many Chinese the financial crisis of 2008 swept aside the need for humility. It set America back while China thrived. President Xi Jinping has since promoted his “Chinese Dream” of a nation that stands tall in the world. Many Chinese see America as a hypocrite that commits all the sins it accuses China of. The time to hide and bide is over.

在同一时间，中国正经历其自身的变化。中国战略专家一直怀疑美国正秘密地希望压制中国的崛起。这就是部分原因，为什么中国尽力用“隐藏其实力以及韬光养晦”来减少对抗。对许多中国人来说，2008年的金融危机让他们把谦虚摆在了一边。当中国蓬勃发展的时候，美国却落后了一步。习近平主席一直推动他的“中国梦”，即一个站在世界之巅的国家。许多中国人把美国人当成伪君子，指控美国在中国犯下的罪行。躲起来等待的时候已经过去了。

This is deeply alarming. According to thinkers such as Graham Allison of Harvard University, history shows how hegemons like the United States and rising powers like China can become locked into a cycle of belligerent rivalry.

这非常令人震惊。根据哈佛大学的格雷厄姆•艾利森(Graham Allison)等思想家认为，历史显示像美国这样的霸权国以及像中国这样的崛起的大国能陷入敌对的恶性循环中。

America fears that time is on China’s side. The Chinese economy is growing more than twice as fast as America’s and the state is pouring money into advanced technology, such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing and biotech. Action that is merely daunting today—to stem the illegal acquisition of intellectual property, say, or to challenge China in the South China Sea—may be impossible tomorrow. Like it or not, the new norms governing how the superpowers will treat each other are being established now. Once expectations have been set, changing them again will be hard. For the sake of mankind, China and America need to come to a peaceful understanding. But how? Mr Trump and his administration have got three things right. The first is that America needs to be strong. It has toughened the rules on takeovers, to give more weight to national security. It has extradited an alleged Chinese intelligence officer from Belgium. It has increased military spending (though the extra money going to Europe still dwarfs that going to the Pacific). And it has just boosted foreign aid in order to counter lavish Chinese investment abroad (see article).

美国担心中国占据了时间的优势。中国的经济的增速是美国的两倍，这个国家对高科技投入了资金，比如人工智能、量子计算及生物技术。这一切仅仅让人觉得气馁——阻止非法获得知识产权，又或者在南海挑战中国——也许明天是不可能实现的。无论喜欢与否，关于超级大国如何对待彼此的新规则现在已经建立了。一旦期望被设定，再次改变其规则将变得十分困难。为了人类，中国和美国需要达成和平谅解。但又如何？特朗普和他的政府已经做对了三件事。第一是美国需要变得强大。政府已经加紧了收购规则，对于国家安全更多的重视。美国已经从比利时引渡了一名中国情报官员。增加军事开支（尽管流入欧洲的额外的资金比流向太平洋的要多得多）。并且其刚刚提高了对外援助为了对抗中国对海外大方的投资。

Mr Trump is also right that America needs to reset expectations about Chinese behaviour. Today’s trading system fails to prevent China’s state-backed firms from blurring the line between commercial interests and the national interest. Government money subsidises and protects companies as they buy up dual-use technology or skew international markets. China has used its state-directed commercial clout in smaller countries to influence foreign policy in, say, the European Union. The West needs transparency about the funding of political parties, think-tanks and university departments.

特朗普也说得对，美国需要重新对中国的行为设定预期。当下的贸易系统不能阻止中国国有企业在商业利润和国家利润之间模糊不清的界定。政府补贴和保护企业随着他们收购军民两用技术以及恶意影响国际市场。中国已经在一些更小的国家使用其国家主导的商业影响力影响其外资政策，比如说，欧盟。西方国家需要政治党派、智库以及大学部门的资金的透明度。

Third, Mr Trump’s unique ability to signal his disregard for conventional wisdom seems to have been effective. He is not subtle or consistent, but as with Canadian and Mexican trade, American bullying can lead to dealmaking. China will not be so easily pushed around—its economy depends less on exports to America than Canada’s and Mexico’s do and Mr Xi cannot afford meekly to disavow his Chinese Dream in front of his people. Yet Mr Trump’s willingness to disrupt and offend has already wrong-footed China’s leaders, who thought they could count on America being unwilling to rock the boat.

第三，特朗普的无视传统智慧的唯一能力似乎很有效。他对事情既不敏感也不从一而终，但是正如与加拿大和墨西哥的贸易协议，美国人的霸凌能促进交易。中国将不再轻易地摆布——其经济对美国出口的依赖比加拿大和墨西哥要小得多，习近平不能在他的人民面前否定他的中国梦。然而特朗普破坏和冒犯中国的想法已经让中国领导人措手不及了，他们以为能指望美国别再给他们捣乱了。

For what comes next, however, Mr Trump needs a strategy, not just tactics. A starting point must be to promote America’s values. Mr Trump acts as if he believes that might is right. He shows a cynical disdain for the values America enshrined in global institutions after the second world war. If he follows that course America will be diminished as an idea and as a moral and political force. When America competes with China as a guardian of a rules-based order, it starts from a position of strength. But any Western democracy that enters a ruthless race to the bottom with China will—and should—lose.

然而接下来会发生什么，特朗普需要一些策略，不仅仅是战术。其中一点就是必须弘扬美国的价值观。特朗普行动起来了，假如他相信这些策略可能是正确的。他在二战后全球体系中，对美国所珍视的价值观表现出一种愤世嫉俗的蔑视。如果他选择这条路，那么美国作为一种理念、一种道德以及一种政治力量将会被削弱。当美国作为基于规则的秩序守护者与中国竞争的时候，它应该从一个强势的角色开始。但是任何西方的民主与中国进入一场残酷的竞次竞争时——将会输，也应该输。

The strategy should leave room for China to rise peacefully—which inevitably also means allowing China to extend its influence. That is partly because a zero-sum attempt at containment is likely to lead to conflict. But it is also because America and China need to co-operate despite their rivalry. The two countries are more commercially intertwined than America and the Soviet Union ever were. And they share responsibilities including—even if Mr Trump denies it—the environment and security interests, such as the Korean peninsula. And America’s strategy must include the asset that separates it most clearly from China: alliances. In trade, for example, Mr Trump should work with the EU and Japan to press China to change. In defence Mr Trump should not only abandon his alliance-bashing but bolster old friends, like Japan and Australia, while nurturing new ones, like India and Vietnam. Alliances are America’s best source of protection against the advantage China will reap from its increasing economic and military power.

这个策略会留给中国空间和平地崛起——这也不可避免地意味着允许中国去扩张其影响力。部分原因是因为遏制零和博弈的苗头可能导致了冲突。但这也是因为美国和中国需要相互合作，尽管之间存在竞争。这两个国家在商业上千丝万楼的关系比美国与前苏联的关系更有过之而无不及。他们承担的责任包括——假如特朗普否定这一点的话——环境和安全利益，比如像朝鲜半岛。美国的策略必须包括清楚地与中国分离出来的一样东西：同盟。在贸易上，比如，特朗普应该与欧盟与日本合作以及迫使中国作出改变。在防御上，特朗普不应该仅仅放弃他抨击同盟的言论，在培养新的关系，如印度和越南时，更应该支持一些老朋友，如日本和澳洲。同盟是美国最好的保护资源，以对抗中国从日益增长的经济和军事力量中获益的优势。

Perhaps it was inevitable that China and America would end up rivals. It is not inevitable that rivalry must lead to war.

也许中国和美国将终止竞争是必然的。竞争导致战争并非必然。
