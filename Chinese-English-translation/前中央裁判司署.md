Declared Monument Former Central Magistracy

法定古迹 前中央裁判司署

The former Central Magistracy is one of the oldest surviving law court 
Building in Hong Kong.

前中央裁判司署是香港现存最古老法庭建筑物之一。

An earlier and smaller magistracy was built on the same site in 1847. Public hangings, visible from Arbuthnot Road, took place in a yard in front of it. The old magistracy was demolished in 1912 to make way for the present building.

早于一八四七年的，该址已建有一所较小的裁判司署，从亚毕诺道可看到其前方空地上公开执行绞刑的情况。旧裁判司署于一九一二年拆卸，原址兴建现有的建筑物。

With the site sloping downwards from south to north, the lower storey forms a basement on the south side but is at ground level on the north. The principal façade, on the east, towers above a high, solid revetment wall. The wall is pierced by six roundels and a recessed central doorway decorated in finely dressed granite. This doorway was the magistrates’ entrance.

该址地势由南向北倾斜，建筑物低层的南面建为地库，而北面则处于地面水平。建筑物东面的正立面外墙矗立在高耸坚固的护土墙上。墙身开凿了六个圆窗，正中位置嵌有门道，由经过精细打磨的花岗石筑成，是供裁判司使用的入口。

The whole neo-classical façade presents a majestic appearance highlighted by such distinctive stylistic elements as the use of the giant order, the Greek key string course and keystone arches. It also features a verandah with six two-storey-high Doric fluted columns supporting a frieze. Above the frieze is an open attic surmounted by a simple entablature with a date stone.

建筑物整幅正面外墙属于新古典风格，外观雄伟，装饰别具特色，其巨大圆柱、希腊风格的带状回纹装饰、拱门及券心石尤为突出。此外，游廊由六根楼高两层、并饰以凹槽的多立克式圆柱建成；圆柱支撑其上的檐壁，檐壁之上是开放式顶层，上为刻有年份的简约檐楣。

The new Central Magistracy was completed in 1914 and the courts in it opened in April 1915. Closed down in 1979, the Magistracy was used temporarily as a High Court annex, and then as offices by the Immigration Department and police officers’ associations.

新的中央裁判司署于一九一四年落成，署内法庭则于一九一五年四月启用，至一九七九年正式关闭。其后，建筑特曾先后用作高等法院附属建筑，以及入境事务处和警务人员组织的办事处。

The former Central Magistracy, the old Central Police Station Compound and the old Victoria Prison Compound form a unique cluster of buildings through which the historical development of the institutions for law and order in Hong Kong since the mid-19th century can be traced. 

前中央裁判司署、旧中区警署和旧域多利监狱组成一个独特的建筑群，勾划出香港自十九世纪中叶以来法治机构的历史发展。

The former Central Magistracy was declared a monument on 8 September 1995 and is protected under the Antiquities and Monuments Ordinance.

前中央裁判司署于一九九五年九月八日列为法定古迹，受《古物及古迹条例》保护。
