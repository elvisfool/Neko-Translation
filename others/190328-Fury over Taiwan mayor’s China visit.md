Fury over Taiwan mayor’s China visit

对台湾市长大陆之行的不满

Some of Han Kuo-yu’s meetings with senior Chinese cadres were not officially scheduled

韩国瑜与一些中国高层的见面并非官方会晤

Taiwanese officials in charge of relations with China have joined a chorus of criticism against Kaohsiung Mayor Han Kuo-yu, who is now on a high-profile visit to mainland Chinese cities.

负责对华关系的台湾官员也批评高雄市长韩国瑜，而后者正在大陆高调访问。


Han, a rising star in the island’s opposition Kuomintang party who shot to fame after a landslide victory in last year’s Kaohsiung mayoral election, is tipped as a KMT contender in the 2020 presidential race.

韩国瑜，在去年高雄市长选举中，以压倒性胜利击败台湾在野党国民党后，一举成为一名政治新星，也被认为在2020年总统选举中国民党最有力的竞争对手。


Kaohsiung, Taiwan’s second largest city, used to be a bastion for the ruling, independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party . The fact that Han, an advocate of the “one China” principle, was able to win a mayoral poll held in a DPP stronghold has instantly made him a presidential candidate backed by Beijing. The VIP escort and reception that Hong Kong, Macau and Shenzhen have accorded to Han are also indicative of Beijing’s high hopes for the up-and-coming Taiwanese politician.

高雄作为台湾最二大城市，曾经是有独立倾向民进党的根据地。事实上，韩国瑜提出的“一个中国”原则，使其在民进党大本营中获得市长选举。在香港、澳门以及深圳的VIP礼遇也被认为是北京对这位崭露头角的台湾政治家寄予了厚望。


Yet Han, still riding a popularity wave, has come under fire for his tête-à-tête style talks and dinners with high-ranking Chinese officials in Hong Kong, Macau and Shenzhen over the past weekend, after the itinerary issued ahead of his trip failed to mention the politically-charged meetings.

然而对于韩国瑜而言，依然人气高涨，出行前发布的行程中并没有提及这些充满政治色彩的会谈，然而在香港、澳门以及深圳在过去几周里，与中国高级别的官员进行密谈后，引起了众多抨击。

Han dined with Beijing’s top envoys in Hong Kong and Macau and also met Liu Jieyi, director of the Chinese State Council’s Taiwan Affairs Office, in Shenzhen on Monday.

韩国瑜否认有香港和澳门与几位中国高级特见面，也否认周一在深圳与国务院台湾事务办公室主任刘结一的见面。

Han owes an explanation to the public, said Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council, after he rubbed shoulders with many senior Chinese officials and party cadres, causing considerable concern among the Taiwanese.

台湾陆委会表示，韩国瑜应该向公众解释， 他与许多大陆高级官员以及党内干部接触后，引起台湾人极大的关注。

Han’s meeting on Friday with Wang Zhimin, head of Beijing’s Liaison Office in Hong Kong after a lunch with the city’s leader Carrie Lam, caught many by surprise as it was not included in the itinerary that Han’s office released before he departed Kaohsiung.

在周五，在与香港特首林郑月娥午宴后，他与香港中联办主任王志文会面，让人为之震惊，因为此前他离开高雄时，他的办公室发布的行程中并没有包括该活动。

Wang reportedly extolled Han’s patriotism and expanded on how Taiwan could benefit from Beijing’s offer of “one country, two systems”.
The hours-long talk between Han and Wang behind closed doors stoked speculation that Han could have tacitly endorsed Beijing’s “one country, two systems” formula currently in place in Hong Kong and Macau, which is also intended for Taiwan to realize reunification. Some critics said Han lacked the political prudence in deciding who to meet in Hong Kong, as Hong Kong and Taiwan affairs were always intertwined.

据闻王志文赞扬了韩国瑜的爱国情怀，并阐述了台湾如何能从北京提出的“一国两制”中获益。
一个小时韩王的闭门会谈引起了猜测，韩国瑜也许会默认北京在香港和澳门实行的的“一国两制”，这也是为了使台湾实行统一。由于香港和台湾事务总是互相交织，一些批评者认为韩国瑜决定在香港与谁会面时缺乏政治审慎。


Meanwhile, Hong Kong lawmakers who are members of the city’s pan-democratic bloc have also slammed Han’s meeting with Wang.

Taiwan’s central government stressed that mayors and other regional officials entering into political negotiations with Chinese cadres and signing deals without prior authorization may overstep the authority of the Mainland Affairs Council, and in doing so break laws.
Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen, who is currently visiting the is currently visiting the island’s allies in the South Pacific region, told reporters that Han must report to the central government about who he met in China.

Han is leading a 28-member delegation on a visit to Hong Kong, Macau and the Chinese cities of Shenzhen and Xiamen to promote trade, tourism and investment, according to his aides.

与此同时，香港泛民集团成员的立法者也抨击了两人的会面。台湾中央政府强调市长和其他地方官员与中国官员进行政治谈判并签署协议，如果未经事前授权，可能会超越内地事务委员会的权限触犯法律。台湾总统蔡英文，日前访问台湾在南太平洋的盟友时，向记者透露，韩国瑜必须向中央政府报告他在中国与谁会见。韩国瑜率领28人代表团访问香港、澳门以及中国城市深圳和厦门，据他的助手说，这次行程将促进贸易、旅游以及投资。
