IN THE past 25 years war has claimed too many lives. Yet even as civil and religious strife have raged in Syria, central Africa, Afghanistan and Iraq, a devastating clash between the world’s great powers has remained almost unimaginable.
在过去25年战争夺去了太多人的生命。然而在叙利亚，中非，阿富汗和伊朗国内和宗教冲突依然持续，在世界大国间毁灭性的冲突几乎不可想象。
 
religious strife宗教冲突 a devastating clash 毁灭性冲突
 
No longer. Last week the Pentagon issued a new national defence strategy that put China and Russia above jihadism as the main threat to America. This week the chief of Britain’s general staff warned of a Russian attack. Even now America and North Korea are perilously close to a conflict that risks dragging in China or escalating into nuclearcatastrophe.

而这一切都不复从前。上周，五角大楼颁布了一项新的国防战略，将中国和俄罗斯放在对美国有主要威胁的圣战组织的排名前。本周英国总参谋长对俄罗斯的袭击提出警告。而现在美国与北韩的冲突箭在弦上，冒着拖中国下水以及把冲突升级到核灾难的风险。
 
As our special report this week on the future of war argues, powerful, long-term shifts in geopolitics and the proliferation of new technologies are eroding the extraordinary military dominance that America and its allies have enjoyed. Conflict on a scale and intensity not seen since the second world war is once again plausible. The world is not prepared.
正如上周的特别报道——在未来的战争中，地缘政治和新技术的扩展在长期转变中正变得非常有力——正在摧毁美国及其盟友一直沉醉的非凡的军事主导地位。从未见过自二战以来如此大规模和强度的冲突，而冲突有可能再次发生。世界并没有准备好迎接这一切。

The pressing danger is of war on the Korean peninsula, perhaps this year. Donald Trump has vowed to prevent Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s leader, from being able to strike America with nuclear-armed ballistic missiles, a capability that recent tests suggest he may have within months, if not already. Among many contingency plans, the Pentagon is considering a disabling pre-emptive strike against the North’s nuclear sites. Despite low confidence in the success of such a strike, it must be prepared to carry out the president’s order should he give it.
也许今年最紧迫的危险处于朝鲜半岛。唐纳•特郎普誓言要制止北韩领袖金正恩，以防止带有核弹头的弹导导弹能袭击美国，假如过去没有这个能力的话，那么在最近数月的导弹测试中已经表明具备这种能力。在许多应急计划中，五角大楼将不考虑先发制人地打击北韩的核设施。尽管对这样的打击信心不足，但必须随时准备好执行总统的指令。

Even a limited attack could trigger all-out war. Analysts reckon that North Korean artillery can bombard Seoul, the South Korean capital, with 10,000 rounds a minute. Drones,midget submarines and tunnelling commandos could deploy biological, chemical and even nuclear weapons. Tens of thousands of people would perish; many more if nukes were used.
即使有效的攻击也能引发全面战争。分析家估计，北韩的大炮能以每分钟一万发的炮弹轰炸南韩的首都首尔。无人机，微型潜艇和隧道突击队能部署生物，化学甚至核武器。成千上万的人有可能丧生；假如使用核武器会导致更多死亡。

This newspaper has argued that the prospect of such horror means that, if diplomacy fails, North Korea should be contained and deterred instead. Although we stand by our argument, war is a real possibility. Mr Trump and his advisers may conclude that a nuclear North would be so reckless, and so likely to cause nuclear proliferation, that it is better to risk war on the Korean peninsula today than a nuclear strike on an American city tomorrow.本
报认为，这种恐怖的预测意味着，假如外交手段失败，那么取而代之的是北韩应该被遏制和制止。尽管我们坚持自己的观点，战争是真实存在的。特朗普和他的顾问也许推断拥有核武器的北韩会不计后果，以及可能会引起核扩散，今天在朝鲜半岛发动战争比明天美国城市受到核袭击的风险更大。

Even if China stays out of a second Korean war, both it and Russia are entering into a renewal of great-power competition with the West. Their ambitions will be even harder to deal with than North Korea’s. Russia, paradoxically, needs to assert itself now because it is in long-term decline. Its leaders have spent heavily to restore Russia’s hard power, and they are willing to take risks to prove they deserve respect and a seat at the table.
即使中国不参与第二次朝鲜战争，中俄两国都会与西方重新展开大国竞争。相对于朝鲜，他们的野心更大。过去三十年史无前例的经济增长提供了中国大量的财富以改革他们的武装力量，并让其领导人认为属于他们的时刻来了。矛盾的是，俄罗斯现在需要坚持自己的立场因为其经济处于长期衰落当中。俄领导人花巨资以恢复其硬实力，以及他们冒险去证明他们值得尊敬并在谈判桌上有一席之地。

Both countries have benefited from the international order that America did most to establish and guarantee. But they see its pillars—universal human rights, democracy and the rule of law—as an imposition that excuses foreign meddling and undermines their own legitimacy. They are now revisionist states that want to challenge the status quo and look at their regions as spheres of influence to be dominated. For China, that means East Asia; for Russia, eastern Europe and Central Asia.
中俄两国均从由美国国际秩序中受益，这种秩序主要由美国建立和进行保障。但他们只看到自身的利益，普世人权，民主和法治被他们以外国干涉为借口和破坏其自身的合法性为由当作一种负担。他们现在是修正主义国家，这些修正主义国家想要挑战现状，以及把他们的区域当成势力范围。对中国来说就是东亚，对俄罗斯来说就是中欧和中亚。

Neither China nor Russia wants a direct military confrontation with America that they would surely lose. But they are using their growing hard power in other ways, in particular by exploiting a “grey zone” where aggression and coercion work just below the level that would risk military confrontation with the West. In Ukraine Russia has blended force, misinformation, infiltration, cyberwar and economic blackmail in ways that democratic societies cannot copy and find hard to rebuff. China is more cautious, but it has claimed, occupied and garrisoned reefs and shoals in disputed waters.
无论中国或者俄罗斯都不想和美国直接发生他们肯定会输的军事对抗。但他们可以用别的方式来使用其日益增长的硬实力，特别是利用“灰色地带”，在该区域内，进行侵略和胁迫的水平低于与西方发生军事对抗的水平。在乌克兰，俄罗斯融合了军事，错误信息，渗透，网络战争和经济勒索的方式，这些是民主国家不能复制和难以反驳的。中国更加谨慎，在有争议的水域占有和据守珊瑚樵和浅滩。

China and Russia have harnessed military technologies invented by America, such as long-range precision-strike and electromagnetic-spectrum warfare, to raise the cost ofintervention against them dramatically. Both have used asymmetric-warfare strategies to create “anti-access/area denial” networks. China aims to push American naval forcesfar out into the Pacific where they can no longer safely project power into the East and South China Seas. Russia wants the world to know that, from the Arctic to the Black Sea, it can call on greater firepower than its foes—and that it will not hesitate to do so.
 
中俄利用已经发美国明的军事技术，比如远程精确打击和电磁波谱战争，极大地提高了干预的成本。两国还使用不对称战争策略，建立“反介入/区域封锁”的网络。中国旨在让美国海军推进太平洋，在那里，他们不再能部署力量在东海和南海。俄罗斯希望世界能明白一点，从北级圈到黑海，它有号召比它的敌人更强的力量——它会毫不怀疑地这么去做。

If America allows China and Russia to establish regional hegemonies, either consciously or because its politics are too dysfunctional to muster a response, it will have given them a green light to pursue their interests by brute force. When that was last tried, the result was the first world war.
假如美国允许中俄建立区域霸权，要么是有意识，要么是因为政治上功能失调，以致无法得到回应。这会给他们使用蛮力来追逐利益大开绿灯。当这是最后一次尝试时，就是一战的结果。

Nuclear weapons, largely a source of stability since 1945, may add to the danger. Their command-and-control systems are becoming vulnerable to hacking by new cyber-weapons or “blinding” of the satellites they depend on. A country under such an attack could find itself under pressure to choose between losing control of its nuclear weapons or using them.
核武器，自1945年来是区域稳定的最大来源，也许应该加上危险。他们的指挥控制系统正成为用网络武器和他们依赖的卫星“盲点”容易被黑客攻击的地方。在这样的攻击下，一个国家可能会面临在失去核武器的控制或使用它们之间的压力下做出选择。

Vain citadels
What should America do? Almost 20 years of strategic drift has played into the hands of Russia and China. George W. Bush’s unsuccessful wars were a distraction and sapped support at home for America’s global role. Barack Obama pursued a foreign policy of retrenchment, and was openly sceptical about the value of hard power. Today, Mr Trump says he wants to make America great again, but is going about it in exactly the wrong way. He shuns multilateral organisations, treats alliances as unwanted baggage and openly admires the authoritarian leaders of America’s adversaries. It is as if Mr Trump wants America to give up defending the system it created and to join Russia and China as just another truculent revisionist power instead.
美国应该怎么办？近20年战略转向在中俄两国中发挥了作用。乔治布什发动了失败的战争转移了人们的视线并且削弱了国内对美国全球角色的支持。今天，特朗普声称将使美国重新壮大，但只是用一种错误的方式来完成它。这好比川普希望美国放弃自己创建的防御系统，加入俄罗斯和中国，成为另一种野蛮的修正主义力量一样。
 
sapped support at home削弱国内支持
 
America needs to accept that it is a prime beneficiary of the international system and that it is the only power with the ability and the resources to protect it from sustained attack. The soft power of patient and consistent diplomacy is vital, but must be backed by the hard power that China and Russia respect. America retains plenty of that hard power, but it is fast losing the edge in military technology that inspired confidence in its allies and fear in its foes.
美国需要接受国际它是国际体系的主要收益人这一现实，并且它是唯一有能力和资源使来保护其不受持续攻击的国家。耐心和外交的一致性的软实力是非常重要的，但是必须得到中俄尊重的硬实力的支持。美国保留了一些硬帝力，但它迅速失去了军事技术上的优势，而这个军事优势本是激发盟军的信心以及增加敌人的恐惧的。
 
sustained attack持续攻击

To match its diplomacy, America needs to invest in new systems based on robotics, artificial intelligence, big data and directed-energy weapons. Belatedly, Mr Obama realised that America required a concerted effort to regain its technological lead, yet there is no guarantee that it will be the first to innovate. Mr Trump and his successors need to redouble the effort.
为了和外交相衬，美国需要投资一些新的基于机器人技术，人工智能，大数据以及定向能武器。终于，奥巴马意识到美国需要齐心协办，重新恢复其技术领袖地位，然而那并不能保证它将是第一个去创新的国家。特朗普和他的继任者需要加倍地地努力。

The best guarantor of world peace is a strong America. Fortunately, it still enjoys advantages. It has rich and capable allies, still by far the world’s most powerful armed forces, unrivalled war-fighting experience, the best systems engineers and the world’s leading tech firms. Yet those advantages could all too easily be squandered. Without America’s commitment to the international order and the hard power to defend it against determined and able challengers, the dangers will grow. If they do, the future of war could be closer than you think.
世界和平的最佳保障是一个壮大的美国。幸运的是，它依然享有优势。富裕和有能力的战友，到目前为止，依然拥有世界最强大的武装力量，无敌的作战经验，最好的系统工程师和世界领先的技术公司。然而，这些优势很容易被浪费掉。没有美国对国际社会的承诺和使用硬实力去防护有决心和有能力的挑战者的对抗，危险将来持续增长。假如他们这么做了，未来战争能比你想像中更近。
