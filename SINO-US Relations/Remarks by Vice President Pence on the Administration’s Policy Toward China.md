副总统彭斯就美国政府对华政策发表讲话

FOREIGN POLICY

外交政策

Issued on: October 4, 2018 The Hudson Institute Washington, D.C. 11:07 A.M. EDT
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Ken, for that kind introduction. To the Members of the Board of Trustees, to Dr. Michael Pillsbury, to our distinguished guests, and to all of you who, true to your mission in this place, “think about the future in unconventional ways” –- it is an honor to be back at the Hudson Institute.

副总统：谢谢肯恩的介绍。致董事会成员，致迈克儿皮尔斯博格博士，致尊敬的嘉宾以及所有忠于使命的人，“用非传统的方法去思考未来”——很荣幸能回到哈得德研究所。

For more than a half a century, this Institute has dedicated itself to “advancing global security, prosperity, and freedom.” And while Hudson’s hometowns have changed over the years, one thing has been constant: You have always advanced that vital truth, that American leadership lights the way.

半个世纪以来，这个研究所致力于“提高全球安全、繁荣以及自由。”哈德森的故乡在这些年来都发生了变化，有一样东西始终没变：你总是提到始终如一的真理，那就是美国的领导力充当了开路先峰。

And today, speaking of leadership, allow me to begin by bringing greetings from a great champion of American leadership at home and abroad –- I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)

而今天，当我们谈及领导力，请允许我带来一位——无论在国内还是国外——美国领导力的捍卫者，美利坚合众国第45届总统，唐纳·特朗普总统——的问候。

From early in this administration, President Trump has made our relationship with China and President Xi a priority. On April 6th of last year, President Trump welcomed President Xi to Mar-a-Lago. On November 8th of last year, President Trump traveled to Beijing, where China’s leader welcomed him warmly.

从执政初期开始，特朗普总统已经优先考虑中国和习主席与我们的关系。在去年的4月16日，特朗普总统邀请习主席到海湖庄园。在去年的11月8日，特朗普总统访问中国，受到了中国的领导人的热烈欢迎。

Over the course of the past two years, our President has forged a strong personal relationship with the President of the People’s Republic of China, and they’ve worked closely on issues of common interest, most importantly the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

在过去的两年里，我们的总统已经与中国人民共和国主席缔造了强有力的个人关系， 他们在共同利益上并肩作战，最重要的是使朝鲜半岛无核化。

But I come before you today because the American people deserve to know that, as we speak, Beijing is employing a whole-of-government approach, using political, economic, and military tools, as well as propaganda, to advance its influence and benefit its interests in the United States.

但我今天来到这里是因为美国人民应该知道这一切，当我们在这里发言的时候，北京正动用全政府的力量，使用政治、经济以及军事工与政治宣传，去提高其影响力以及有利于其在美国的利益。

China is also applying this power in more proactive ways than ever before, to exert influence and interfere in the domestic policy and politics of this country.

中国也比以往更积极地运作这一力量，去施加影响力以及干预这个内政与政治。

Under President Trump’s leadership, the United States has taken decisive action to respond to China with American action, applying the principles and the policies long advocated in these halls.

在特朗普总统的领导力下，美国采取果断的行动去回应中国在美国的行为，贯彻这个国家里长期倡导的原则和政策。

In our National Security Strategy that the President Trump released last December, he described a new era of “great power competition.” Foreign nations have begun to, as we wrote, “reassert their influence regionally and globally,” and they are “contesting [America’s] geopolitical advantages and trying [in essence] to change the international order in their favor.”

特朗普总统在去年12月发布国家安全战略中，他提出了“大国竞争”的新时代的概念。外国已经开始了，就如我们所描述的，“重申其在区域和全球的影响力”，他们也正在“争论（美国的）地缘政治优势以及试图(实质上)改变有利于他们的国际规则。"

In this strategy, President Trump made clear that the United States of America has adopted a new approach to China. We seek a relationship grounded in fairness, reciprocity, and respect for sovereignty, and we have taken strong and swift action to achieve that goal.

在这个战略中，特朗普总统明显表示，对中国将采取新的态度。我们寻求建立在公平、互惠以及尊重主权的基础上的关系，并且我们会采取迅速并强有力的行动来实现这个目标。

As the President said last year on his visit to China, in his words, “we have an opportunity to strengthen the relationship between our two countries and improve the lives of our citizens.” Our vision of the future is built on the best parts of our past, when America and China reached out to one another in a spirit of openness and friendship.

正如总统在去年访问中国时所说的，“我们有一个机会加强两国的关系以及改善我们国家人民的生活。”我们对未来的憧憬是建立在我们过去交往的最好的一部分中，当美国和中国以开放和友谊的精神相接触的时候。

When our young nation went searching in the wake of the Revolutionary War for new markets for our exports, the Chinese people welcomed American traders laden with ginseng and fur.

当我们这个年轻的国家在革命战争后寻找一个新的出口市场的时候，中国人民欢迎携带着高丽参与皮毛的美国商人。

When China suffered through indignities and exploitations during her so-called “Century of Humiliation,” America refused to join in, and advocated the “Open Door” policy, so that we could have freer trade with China, and preserve their sovereignty.

当中国在称为“百年屈辱”中遭受侮辱和剥削的时候，美国人并不有踩上一脚，并提供“门户开放”政策，使得我们与中国有了自由贸易并且保护他们的主权。

When American missionaries brought the good news to China’s shores, they were moved by the rich culture of an ancient and vibrant people. And not only did they spread their faith, but those same missionaries founded some of China’s first and finest universities. When the Second World War arose, we stood together as allies in the fight against imperialism. And in that war’s aftermath, America ensured that China became a charter member of the United Nations, and a great shaper of the post-war world. But soon after it took power in 1949, the Chinese Communist Party began to pursue authoritarian expansionism. It is remarkable to think that only five years after our nations had fought together, we fought each other in the mountains and valleys of the Korean Peninsula. My own father saw combat on that frontier of freedom.

当美国的传教士把好消息带到中国的海岸线上时，他们被古老和充满活力的人民的丰厚文化所感动。不仅增添了他们的信心，也正是这些传教士在中国建立了最初和最好的大学。当第二次世界大战发生时，我们作为盟友并肩作战反击战国主义。在战后，美国承认中国成为联合国的一个会员国，并且是战后世界伟大的塑造者。但中国在1949年执政后，中国共产党开始追求独裁扩张政策。值得留意的是，在我们共同并肩作战的仅五年后，我们在朝鲜半岛的山间开始互相作战。我自己的父亲在自由的前线里目睹了战争。

But not even the brutal Korean War could diminish our mutual desire to restore the ties that for so long had bound our peoples together. China’s estrangement from the United States ended in 1972, and, soon after, we re-established diplomatic relations and began to open our economies to one another, and American universities began training a new generation of Chinese engineers, business leaders, scholars, and officials.

但是即使是残酷的朝鲜战争也不能削弱我们的共同的愿望，重新恢复长期以来我们两国人民一直团结一起的纽带。中国与美国的隔阂结束于1972年，不久之后，我们重建了外交关系以及开始向对方开放经济政策，美国大学开始培养新一代中国的工程师、商界领导，学者以及官员。但是即使是残酷的朝鲜战争也不能削弱我们的共同的愿望，重新恢复长期以来我们两国人民一直团结一起的纽带。中国与美国的隔阂结束于1972年，不久之后，我们重建了外交关系以及开始向对方开放经济政策，美国大学开始培养新一代中国的工程师、商界领导，学者以及官员。

After the fall of the Soviet Union, we assumed that a free China was inevitable. Heady with optimism at the turn of the 21st Century, America agreed to give Beijing open access to our economy, and we brought China into the World Trade Organization. Previous administrations made this choice in the hope that freedom in China would expand in all of its forms -– not just economically, but politically, with a newfound respect for classical liberal principles, private property, personal liberty, religious freedom — the entire family of human rights. But that hope has gone unfulfilled. The dream of freedom remains distant for the Chinese people. And while Beijing still pays lip service to “reform and opening,” Deng Xiaoping’s famous policy now rings hollow.

苏联解体后，我们认为必然会了现一个自由的中国。21世纪初，乐观主义令人兴奋，美国同意让北京加入我们的经济当中，我们让中国进入了世界贸易组织。前几任政府之所以做出这样的决定，是希望中国的自由能以各种形式进行扩张——而不仅仅在经济上，但是政治上，怀着对古典自由主义、私有财务、个人自由主义以及宗教自由的新敬意——在整个人权世界中。但希望落空了。前几任政府之所以做出这样的决定，是希望中国的自由能以各种形式进行扩张——而不仅仅在经济上，但是政治上，怀着对古典自由主义、私有财务、个人自由主义以及宗教自由的新敬意——在整个人权世界中。但希望落空了。中国人民离自由梦还很遥远。当北京依然口头上表示“改革开放”时，邓小平的著名的政策现在听起来显得很空洞。

Over the past 17 years, China’s GDP has grown nine-fold; it’s become the second-largest economy in the world. Much of this success was driven by American investment in China. And the Chinese Communist Party has also used an arsenal of policies inconsistent with free and fair trade, including tariffs, quotas, currency manipulation, forced technology transfer, intellectual property theft, and industrial subsidies that are handed out like candy to foreign investment. These policies have built Beijing’s manufacturing base, at the expense of its competitors -– especially the United States of America.

在过去的17年的当中，中国的GPD增加了九倍；成为了世界第二大经济体。相当一部分的成功源于美国在中国的投资。以及中国共产党使了一系列与自由与公平贸易的不相称的政策，包括关税、配额、货币操纵、强制技术转让、偷窥知识产权以及向外国投资发放像糖果一样的工业补贴。这些政策建立了北京的制造业基地，以损害竞争对手为代价——特别是美国。

China’s actions have contributed to a trade deficit with the United States that last year ran to $375 billion –- nearly half of our global trade deficit. As President Trump said just this week, in his words, “We rebuilt China” over the last 25 years.

中国的行为已经造成了与美国在去年3750亿美元的贸易逆差——几乎是全球贸易逆差的一半。当特朗普总统在这周表示，用他的话说，在过去的25里“我们要重建中国”。

Now, through the “Made in China 2025” plan, the Communist Party has set its sights on controlling 90 percent of the world’s most advanced industries, including robotics, biotechnology, and artificial intelligence. To win the commanding heights of the 21st century economy, Beijing has directed its bureaucrats and businesses to obtain American intellectual property –- the foundation of our economic leadership -– by any means necessary.

现在，通过“2025中国制造”计划，中国共产党的目标是控制世界上90%最先进的工业，包括机器人、生物技术以及人工智能。为了赢得21世纪经济的制高点，北京已经指示其官员和企业获得美国的知识产权——无论如何——那是我们经济领导地位的基础。

Beijing now requires many American businesses to hand over their trade secrets as the cost of doing business in China. It also coordinates and sponsors the acquisition of American firms to gain ownership of their creations. Worst of all, Chinese security agencies have masterminded the wholesale theft of American technology –- including cutting-edge military blueprints. And using that stolen technology, the Chinese Communist Party is turning plowshares into swords on a massive scale.

北京现在要求许多美国商人交出其商业秘密作为在华经商的代价。中国还协调和赞助了美国公司的收购以获得其产品所有权。最糟糕的是，中国安全部门已经策划了大量美国技术的窃取行为——包括尖端军事蓝图。同时使用偷来的技术应用在大规模的战斗中。

China now spends as much on its military as the rest of Asia combined, and Beijing has prioritized capabilities to erode America’s military advantages on land, at sea, in the air, and in space. China wants nothing less than to push the United States of America from the Western Pacific and attempt to prevent us from coming to the aid of our allies. But they will fail.

现在中国在军事上的开支相当于亚洲其它国家的总和，以及北京优先考虑消弱美国在陆地上、海上、空中以及在太空的军事优势。中国只想把美国从西太平洋赶走，试图阻止我们能援助我们的盟友。但他们将会失败。

Beijing is also using its power like never before. Chinese ships routinely patrol around the Senkaku Islands, which are administered by Japan. And while China’s leader stood in the Rose Garden at the White House in 2015 and said that his country had, and I quote, “no intention to militarize” the South China Sea, today, Beijing has deployed advanced anti-ship and anti-air missiles atop an archipelago of military bases constructed on artificial islands.

北京也前所未有的使用其实力。中国的船舶经常在尖阁列岛巡航，而那里属日本管制。2015年，当中国的领导人站在白宫的玫瑰园的时候，表示他的国家，我在这里引用他所说的，在南中国海“没有军事化的意图”，而今天，北京已经在人工岛上建造的军事基地上空，部署了高级反舰和防空导弹。

China’s aggression was on display this week, when a Chinese naval vessel came within 45 yards of the USS Decatur as it conducted freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea, forcing our ship to quickly maneuver to avoid collision. Despite such reckless harassment, the United States Navy will continue to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows and our national interests demand. We will not be intimidated and we will not stand down. (Applause.)

中国在这周展现了其侵略行为，当一艘中国海军舰艇在南中国海执行自由航行行动时，距离迪凯特号驱逐舰不足45码，迫使我们的舰艇快速航行以免发生碰撞。尽管受到了鲁莽的骚扰，美国海军将继续飞行、航行以及在国际法允许和国家利益需要的地方行使使命。我们不会被吓倒，也不会退缩。（掌声）

America had hoped that economic liberalization would bring China into a greater partnership with us and with the world. Instead, China has chosen economic aggression, which has in turn emboldened its growing military.

美国曾经希望经济自由化能使中国与美国和全球建立更好的伙伴关系。相反，中国已经选择了经济侵略，这反过来又助长了中国日益壮大的军事力量。

Nor, as we had hoped, has Beijing moved toward greater freedom for its own people. For a time, Beijing inched toward greater liberty and respect for human rights. But in recent years, China has taken a sharp U-turn toward control and oppression of its own people.

也不是我们希望的那样，北京已经为本国人民走向了更大的自由。曾有一段时期，北京逐渐向更大的自由和尊重人权迈进。但是近年来，中国却急转弯，操控和镇压本国人民。

Today, China has built an unparalleled surveillance state, and it’s growing more expansive and intrusive – often with the help of U.S. technology. What they call the “Great Firewall of China” likewise grows higher, drastically restricting the free flow of information to the Chinese people.

今天，中国已经建立了一个空前的监控式的国家——通常在美国技术的帮助下——它的范围越来越广并且具有侵入性。他们所谓的“中国防火墙”同样也变得更高，极大地限制了中国人民的信息自由。

And by 2020, China’s rulers aim to implement an Orwellian system premised on controlling virtually every facet of human life — the so-called “Social Credit Score.” In the words of that program’s official blueprint, it will “allow the trustworthy to roam everywhere under heaven, while making it hard for the discredited to take a single step.”

在2020年，中国的统治者计划执行一个以控制人类生活的每一个方面为前提的奥威尔系统——称之为“社会信息等级”。用该计划的官方蓝图的话来说，这将“让守信的人行走天下，同时也让那些名誉扫地的人难以出行。”

And when it comes to religious freedom, a new wave of persecution is crashing down on Chinese Christians, Buddhists, and Muslims. Last month, Beijing shut down one of China’s largest underground churches. Across the country, authorities are tearing down crosses, burning bibles, and imprisoning believers. And Beijing has now reached a deal with the Vatican that gives the avowedly atheist Communist Party a direct role in appointing Catholic bishops. For China’s Christians, these are desperate times.

上个月，北京关闭了中国最大的一间地下教堂。放眼全国，当局者正拆卸十字架，焚烧圣经以及囚禁信徒。北京现在与梵蒂冈达成协议，给予无神论的共产党任命主教的角色。对于中国的基督徒而言，这是令人绝望的时刻。

Beijing is also cracking down on Buddhism. Over the past decade, more than 150 Tibetan Buddhist monks have lit themselves on fire to protest China’s repression of their beliefs and their culture. And in Xinjiang, the Communist Party has imprisoned as many as one million Muslim Uyghurs in government camps where they endure around-the-clock brainwashing. Survivors of the camps have described their experiences as a deliberate attempt by Beijing to strangle Uyghur culture and stamp out the Muslim faith.

北京也镇压佛教徒。在过去的二十年里，有超过150名西藏佛教徒通过自焚来抗议中国对他们信仰和文化的镇压。在新疆，共产党也 关禁了一百万维吾尔穆斯林在政府的集中营，在那里他们忍受着不间断的洗脑活动。从那里出来的生还者描述他们的经历就像是一场试验，北京扼杀维吾尔人的文化以及消灭穆斯林信仰。

As history attests though, a country that oppresses its own people rarely stops there. And Beijing also aims to extend its reach across the wider world. As Hudson’s own Dr. Michael Pillsbury has written, “China has opposed the actions and goals of the U.S. government. Indeed, China is building its own relationships with America’s allies and enemies that contradict any peaceful or productive intentions of Beijing.”

但历史证明了一点，一个镇压国民的国家往往停不下来。北京也旨在将其爪牙扩张至全球。正如哈德森的拥有者迈克·斯皮尔伯里写的那样，“中国已经反对美国政府的行动和目标了。确实，中国正在建立其与美国盟友和敌人的关系，这些盟友与敌人都与北京任何和平或富有成效的意图相抵触。”

In fact, China uses so-called “debt diplomacy” to expand its influence. Today, that country is offering hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure loans to governments from Asia to Africa to Europe and even Latin America. Yet the terms of those loans are opaque at best, and the benefits invariably flow overwhelmingly to Beijing.

事实上，中国使用所谓的“债务外交”去扩张其影响力。今天，这个正在向从亚洲到欧洲以及拉丁美洲的政府提供上千亿美元基础设施贷款。然而这些贷款的条款都是不透明的，以及收益无一例外总是倾向于北京。

Just ask Sri Lanka, which took on massive debt to let Chinese state companies build a port of questionable commercial value. Two years ago, that country could no longer afford its payments, so Beijing pressured Sri Lanka to deliver the new port directly into Chinese hands. It may soon become a forward military base for China’s growing blue-water navy.

只需问下斯里兰卡，这个国家负债累累只为了让中国公司建了一个可疑的具有商业价值的港口。两年后，这个国家不能再提供还款，于是北京向斯里兰卡施压，将这个新港口直接交付给中国人使用。这也许在不久以后，会成为中国正在发展的深海海军的军事基地。

Within our own hemisphere, Beijing has extended a lifeline to the corrupt and incompetent Maduro regime in Venezuela that’s been oppressing its own people. They pledged $5 billion in questionable loans to be repaid with oil. China is also that country’s single largest creditor, saddling the Venezuelan people with more than $50 billion in debt, even as their democracy vanishes. Beijing is also impacting some nations’ politics by providing direct support to parties and candidates who promise to accommodate China’s strategic objectives.

在东半球，北京已经向腐败无能的，镇压其国民的马杜罗政权伸出了援助之手。他们承诺用石油来偿还可疑的50亿美元贷款。中国同时也是这个国家的最大债权国，委内瑞拉人民背负着超过500亿美金的债务，甚至在失去民主的时候。北京也在影响一些国家的政治通过提供直接的资助给党派或者候选人，这部分人承诺将会配合中国的战略目标。

And since last year alone, the Chinese Communist Party has convinced three Latin American nations to sever ties with Taipei and recognize Beijing. These actions threaten the stability of the Taiwan Strait, and the United States of America condemns these actions. And while our administration will continue to respect our One China Policy, as reflected in the three joint communiqués and the Taiwan Relations Act, America will always believe that Taiwan’s embrace of democracy shows a better path for all the Chinese people. (Applause.)

去年开始，中国共产党已经说服三个拉丁美洲国家与台北断交并只承认北京政权。这样的行为会威胁海峡地区的稳定，美国谴责这种行为。虽然我们的政府将依据三个联合公报以及《台湾关系法》，继续尊重一个中国政策，美国会一直相信台湾与民主同在，台湾向中国人民展示了一条更好地通往民主的道路。

Now these are only a few of the ways that China has sought to advance its strategic interests across the world, with growing intensity and sophistication. Yet previous administrations all but ignored China’s actions. And in many cases, they abetted them. But those days are over.

现在，这只是中国在全球范围内寻求其战略利益方式的一小部分，随着这些方式的强度和复杂性的不断提高。然而，前几任政府都几乎忽略了中国的行为。在许多情况下，他们起了煽动的作用。但那些日子都过去了。

Under President Trump’s leadership, the United States of America has been defending our interests with renewed American strength. We’ve been making the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still. Earlier this year, President Trump signed into law the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan -– $716 billion to extend the strength of the American military to every domain.

在特朗普的领导下，随着美国力量的兴起，美国已经开始捍卫自身的利益。我们使世界历史上最强大的军队依然更加的强大。在今年的早些时候，特朗普总统签署一份自罗纳德·里根以来，国防力量规模最大的法案——7160亿美元——使得美国国防力量扩展到各个领域。

We’re modernizing our nuclear arsenal. We’re fielding and developing new cutting-edge fighters and bombers. We’re building a new generation of aircraft carriers and warships. We’re investing as never before in our armed forces. And this includes initiating the process to establish the United States Space Force to ensure our continued dominance in space, and we’ve taken action to authorize increased capability in the cyber world to build deterrence against our adversaries.

我们让自己的核武库现代化。我们正在部署和开发新型尖端战斗机和轰炸机。我们正在建造新一代的航空母舰和军舰。我们对武装力量的投放前所未有。这包括启动建立美国太空力量的进程以继续确保我们在太空的主宰力量，同时，我们已经增加授权去增加网络世界的能力，建立对敌人的威摄。

At President Trump’s direction, we’re also implementing tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods, with the highest tariffs specifically targeting the advanced industries that Beijing is trying to capture and control. And as the President has also made clear, we will levy even more tariffs, with the possibility of substantially more than doubling that number, unless a fair and reciprocal deal is made. (Applause.)

按照特朗普总统的指示，我们也对中国货品实施2500亿美元的关税，最高的关税特别针对北京试图获得和控制的先进工业。同时，正如特朗普总统明确表示的那样，我们将来征收更多的关税，除非达成公平互惠的交易，否则这一数字有可能翻倍。

These actions — exercises in American strength — have had a major impact. China’s largest stock exchange fell by 25 percent in the first nine months of this year, in large part because our administration has been standing strong against Beijing’s trade practices. As President Trump has made clear, we don’t want China’s markets to suffer. In fact, we want them to thrive. But the United States wants Beijing to pursue trade policies that are free, fair, and reciprocal. And we will continue to stand and demand that they do. (Applause.) Sadly, China’s rulers, thus far, have refused to take that path. The American people deserve to know: In response to the strong stand that President Trump has taken, Beijing is pursuing a comprehensive and coordinated campaign to undermine support for the President, our agenda, and our nation’s most cherished ideals.actions here at home — some of which we’ve gleaned from intelligence assessments, some of which are publicly available. But all of which are fact.

那些行为——美国武装力量的演习——已经产生了主要的影响。中国最大的证券交易在今年的前九个月所下挫25%，很大一部分原因是因为我们政府坚决反对北京的贸易惯例。也正如特朗普总统明确表示的那样，我们不希望中国的市场遭受损失。事实上，我们希望他们繁荣。但是美国希望北京能实现自由、公平以及互惠的贸易政策。我们将继续支持和要求他们这样做。可悲的是，到目前为止，中国的统治者已经拒绝那样的选择。美国人民有权利知道：作为对强硬立场的回应，特朗普总统已经提出了课程表和我们最珍视的理念——此时，北京正寻求广泛与协同活动以消弱总统的支持。今天，我希望告诉你们，我们在国内知道中国的行为——我们从情报评估中收集了一些信息，其中一些信息是公开的。但所有这些都是事实。

s I said before, as we speak, Beijing is employing a whole-of-government approach to advance its influence and benefit its interests. It’s employing this power in more proactive and coercive ways to interfere in the domestic policies of this country and to interfere in the politics of the United States.The Chinese Communist Party is rewarding or coercing American businesses, movie studios, universities, think tanks, scholars, journalists, and local, state, and federal officials.And worst of all, China has initiated an unprecedented effort to influence American public opinion, the 2018 elections, and the environment leading into the 2020 presidential elections. To put it bluntly, President Trump’s leadership is working; and China wants a different American President.

正如我之前所说，当我们说出来，北京正部署一个政府对策去提高其影响力以及使其利益收惠。它以更主动和强制的方式使用权力来干涉这些国家的国内政策以及干涉美国的政治。中国共产党正奖励或强迫美国的商人、电影业、大学、智库、学者、记者以及当地人、州以及联邦政府。最糟糕的是，中国已经开始前所未有的行动去影响美国的民意，2018年的选举以及影响2020年总统选举的环境。坦白地说，特朗普总统的领导力正在发生作用；中国希望看到不一样的总统。

There can be no doubt: China is meddling in America’s democracy. As President Trump said just last week, we have, in his words, “found that China has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming [midterm] election[s].” Our intelligence community says that “China is targeting U.S. state and local governments and officials to exploit any divisions between federal and local levels on policy. It’s using wedge issues, like trade tariffs, to advance Beijing’s political influence.” In June, Beijing itself circulated a sensitive document, entitled “Propaganda and Censorship Notice.” It laid out its strategy. It stated that China must, in their words, “strike accurately and carefully, splitting apart different domestic groups” in the United States of America.

不容置疑：中国正在干预美国的民主。正如特朗普总统在上周所说的那样，我们已经，“发现，中国正打算干涉我们即将来临的选举。” 我们情报部门表示，“中国正以美国、本地政府和高官为目标，利用联邦政府和本地阶层在政策上的分歧。使用分化对方支持者的议题，像贸易关税，去提高北京的政治影响力。” 在六月，北京透露一份敏感文件，题为“宣传和审查通知”。北京制定了策略。文件规定了中国必须，用他们的话说，“准确而仔细地打击、分裂美国国内不同的团体”。

To that end, Beijing has mobilized covert actors, front groups, and propaganda outlets to shift Americans’ perception of Chinese policy. As a senior career member of our intelligence community told me just this week, what the Russians are doing pales in comparison to what China is doing across this country. And the American people deserve to know it.

最后，北京开始动员秘密行为者、前线部队以及宣传媒体去改变美国人对中国政策的看法。正如本周我们情报部门的一位资深成员告诉我的那样，俄罗斯的所作所为与中国在美国所做的一切相比，相形见绌。这些美国人民有权利知道。

Senior Chinese officials have also tried to influence business leaders to encourage them to condemn our trade actions, leveraging their desire to maintain their operations in China. In one recent example, China threatened to deny a business license for a major U.S. corporation if they refused to speak out against our administration’s policies.

中国高级官员也试图影响商界领导，鼓励其去谴责我们的贸易行动，利用其欲望去获得中国的生意。在最近的一些案例中，中国威胁对美国一家大公司拒绝颁发营业执照，假如这家美国公司拒绝公开反对我们政府的政策。

And when it comes to influencing the midterms, you need only look at Beijing’s tariffs in response to ours. The tariffs imposed by China to date specifically targeted industries and states that would play an important role in the 2018 election. By one estimate, more than 80 percent of U.S. counties targeted by China voted for President Trump and I in 2016; now China wants to turn these voters against our administration.
当涉及到影响中期选举时，你只要看看北京关于关税问题对我们的回应就知道了。中国对特定工业和州征收的关税将会在2018年的中期选举中起着重要的作用。据估计，被中国定为目标的80%的美国县城的选民和我，在2016年投票给特朗普总统；而现在，中国希望利用这些选民反过来反对我们的政府。

And China is also directly appealing to the American voters. Last week, the Chinese government paid to have a multipage supplement inserted into the Des Moines Register –- the paper of record of the home state of our Ambassador to China, and a pivotal state in 2018 and 2020. The supplement, designed to look like the news articles, cast our trade policies as reckless and harmful to Iowans. Fortunately, Americans aren’t buying it. For example, American farmers are standing with this President and are seeing real results from the strong stands that he’s taken, including this week’s U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, where we’ve substantially opened North American markets to U.S. products. The USMCA is a great win for American farmers and American manufacturers. (Applause.)

中国也直接呼吁美国选民。在上周，中国政府出资在《梅因登纪要》中插入多页增刊——这是我国驻中国大使的本国记录文件，是一个在2018年和2020年的关键州。这个增刊，设计得看起来就像是新闻报道一样，把我们的贸易政策看成是对爱荷华州鲁莽和有害的行为。幸运的是，美国人并不买帐。比如，美国农场主与总统站边，看到了他采取的强硬立场所产生的真实成果，包括这周美墨加协定，我们向美国产品充分开放北美市场。USMCA是对美国农场主和美国制造业一次伟大的胜利。

But China’s actions aren’t focused solely on influencing our policies and politics. Beijing is also taking steps to exploit its economic leverage, and the allure of their large marketplace, to advance its influence over American businesses.Beijing now requires American joint ventures that operate in China to establish what they call “party organizations” within their company, giving the Communist Party a voice –- and perhaps a veto -– in hiring and investment decisions.

但中国的行为并不仅仅集中影响我们的政策和政治。北京也在采取措施利用其经济杠杆以及巨大市场的吸引力，通过美国的商人提高其影响力。现在，北京要求美国在中国的合资公司内部建立其称之为“党组织”，让中国共产党听到一种声音——也许是反对的声音——在招聘和投资决策方面。

Chinese authorities have also threatened U.S. companies that depict Taiwan as a distinct geographic entity, or that stray from Chinese policy on Tibet. Beijing compelled Delta Airlines to publicly apologize for not calling Taiwan a “province of China” on its website. And it pressured Marriott to fire a U.S. employee who merely liked a tweet about Tibet.And Beijing routinely demands that Hollywood portray China in a strictly positive light. It punishes studios and producers that don’t. Beijing’s censors are quick to edit or outlaw movies that criticize China, even in minor ways. For the movie, “World War Z,” they had to cut the script’s mention of a virus because it originated in China. The movie, “Red Dawn” was digitally edited to make the villains North Korean, not Chinese.

中国政府也威胁把美国企业，那些把台湾描述为另一个国家或者西藏问题上偏离中国政策的美国企业。北京迫使达美航空公开道歉，因为不在网站上把台湾称为“中国的一个省”。同时施压给万豪酒店，解雇一名仅仅在西藏的推文上点赞的员工。北京老是要求好莱坞用绝对积极的眼光来描绘中国。否则就会惩罚电影工作室和制作方，如果他们不这么做的话。北京对批评中国电编辑和取缔是迅速的，即使在很小的方面批评中国。一部电影名为“僵尸世界大战“，他们删除了剧本中提到的一种起源于中国的病毒。另一部电影，”赤色黎明”是通过数字剪辑制作的电影，把里面的反派角色变成朝鲜人，而不是中国人。

But beyond business and entertainment, the Chinese Communist Party is also spending billions of dollars on propaganda outlets in the United States and, frankly, around the world.China Radio International now broadcasts Beijing-friendly programs on over 30 U.S. outlets, many in major American cities. The China Global Television Network reaches more than 75 million Americans, and it gets its marching orders directly from its Communist Party masters. As China’s top leader put it during a visit to the network’s headquarters, and I quote, “The media run by the Party and the government are propaganda fronts and must have the Party as their surname.”

但除了商业和娱乐，中国共产党也正花费数十亿美元在美国的宣传媒体上，坦白说，是全世界。中国国际广播电台现在在美国超过30个媒体上播报亲北京的新闻，许多在美国主要的城市。中国国际电视网的收视遍及7500美国人，它直接从中国共产党那里得到行军令。正如中国最高领导人在访问网络总部那样，我引用一下，“媒体由党领导，政府是宣传前线，媒体必须姓党。”

It’s for those reasons and that reality that, last month, the Department of Justice ordered that network to register as a foreign agent. The Communist Party has also threatened and detained the Chinese family members of American journalists who pry too deep. And it’s blocked the websites of U.S. media organizations and made it harder for our journalists to get visas. This happened after the New York Times published investigative reports about the wealth of some of China’s leaders.But the media isn’t the only place where the Chinese Communist Party seeks to foster a culture of censorship. The same is true across academia. 

基于这些原因和事实，上个月，司法部下令该网络注册为外国特工。共产党也威胁和扣留深入调查新闻的美国记者的中国家庭成员。屏蔽美国媒体组织的网站，增加我们记者的签证难度。这一切都发生在《纽约时报》发表了一篇关于某些中国领导人的财富的调查报告之后。但是媒体并不是中国共产党唯一试图培养审查文化的地方。学术界也如此。

I mean, look no further than the Chinese Students and Scholars Association, of which there are more than 150 branches across America’s campuses. These groups help organize social events for some of the more than 430,000 Chinese nationals studying in the United States. They also alert Chinese consulates and embassies when Chinese students, and American schools, stray from the Communist Party line. At the University of Maryland, a Chinese student recently spoke at her graduation of what she called, and I quote, the “fresh air of free speech” in America.

我是指，没有比中国学生和学者协会更好的选择了，它们在美国校园里有150多个分支机构。这些团体帮助在美留学的43万中国人组织社交活动。当中国学生以及美国学校偏离共产党的意识形态时，他们也向中国领事馆和大使馆发出警报。在马里兰大学，一名中国学生最近在她的毕业典礼发言，我在这里引用她说的，在美国“言论自由的新闻空气”。

The Communist Party’s official newspaper swiftly chastised her. She became the victim of a firestorm of criticism on China’s tightly-controlled social media, and her family back home was harassed. As for the university itself, its exchange program with China — one of the nation’s most extensive — suddenly turned from a flood to a trickle. 共产党官方媒体迅速地惩罚了她。她成为了中国严加控制社交媒体的批评风暴的受害人，她的家人在家里也被骚扰。至于大学本身，它与中国的交流项目——是中国最广泛的的交流项目之一——突然之间无人闻津。

China exerts academic pressure in other ways, as well. Beijing provides generous funding to universities, think tanks, and scholars, with the understanding that they will avoid ideas that the Communist Party finds dangerous or offensive. China experts in particular know that their visas will be delayed or denied if their research contradicts Beijing’s talking points.

中国也以其它方式向学术界施加压力。北京向大学、智库以及学者提供慷慨的资金，很好理解，他们会避开共产党认为是危险或者是具有冒犯的想法。中国专家特别清楚他们的签证将会得到延期或者他们的研究否定了北京谈话要点的话，就会取消签证。

And even scholars and groups who avoid Chinese funding are targeted by that country, as the Hudson Institute found out firsthand. After you offered to host a speaker Beijing didn’t like, your website suffered a major cyberattack, originating from Shanghai. The Hudson Institute knows better than most that the Chinese Communist Party is trying to undermine academic freedom and the freedom of speech in America today.

哈德森研究所首次发现，学者和团体避免由中国已经定为目标的课题。当你发表了北京不喜欢的话题的时候，你的网站就会受到来自于上海的网络攻击。哈德逊研究所比很多人都了解，中国共产党正试图破坏当下美国的学术自由以及言论自由。

These and other actions, taken as a whole, constitute an intensifying effort to shift American public opinion and policy away from the “America First” leadership of President Donald Trump.

这些或者其它的行为，总体而言，构成了一种强势的结果: 改变美国公众意见以及使得政策远离特朗普总统"美国第一"的领导力。

But our message to China’s rulers is this: This President will not back down. (Applause.) The American people will not be swayed. And we will continue to stand strong for our security and our economy, even as we hope for improved relations with Beijing. Our administration is going to continue to act decisively to protect America’s interests, American jobs, and American security. As we rebuild our military, we will continue to assert American interests across the Indo-Pacific.

但我们向中国统治者传达的信息是: 总统将不会做出让步。美国人将不会受到影响。我们会继续努力捍卫为我们的国家安全和经济。正如我们们希望改善与北京的关系一样。我们的政府会继续坚定地保护美国的利益，美国人的工作以及美国的国家安全。正如我们重建自己的军事力量，我们将继续在亚太地区维护美国人的利益。

As we respond to China’s trade practices, we will continue to demand an economic relationship with China that is free, fair, and reciprocal. We will demand that Beijing break down its trade barriers, fulfill its obligations, fully open its economy — just as we have opened ours.

正如我们回应中国的贸易惯例，我们将继续要求与中国的经济关系是自由的、公平的以及互惠的。我们将要求北京取消贸易壁垒，履行义务，充分开放经济——就像我们的开放经济政策一样。

We’ll continue to take action against Beijing until the theft of American intellectual property ends once and for all. And we will continue to stand strong until Beijing stops the predatory practice of forced technology transfer. We will protect the private property interests of American enterprise. (Applause.)

我们将继续采取行动反击北京直到其结束盗窃美国的知识产权。我们将继续坚定立场直到北京停止强制技术转让的掠夺行为。我们将保护美国企业私有财产的利益。

And to advance our vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, we’re building new and stronger bonds with nations that share our values across the region, from India to Samoa. Our relationships will flow from a spirit of respect built on partnership, not domination. We’re forging new trade deals on a bilateral basis, just as last week President Trump signed an improved trade deal with South Korea. And we will soon begin historic negotiations for a bilateral free-trade deal with Japan. (Applause.)

以及促进我们对自由开放的亚太地区的愿景，我们正建立一个新的，有力的，在该地区与我们分享价值的国家的纽带。我们的关系来自于建立在合作伙伴而不是来自于以独尊的精神自居之上。我们在双边基础上正打造一个新的贸易协议，正如上周特朗普总统签署与南韩的修正贸易协议一样。我们在不久将与日本开始关于双边自由贸易协议的历史性的谈判。

I’m also pleased to report that we’re streamlining international development and finance programs. We’ll be giving foreign nations a just and transparent alternative to China’s debt-trap diplomacy. In fact, this week, President Trump will sign the BUILD Act into law. Next month, it will be my privilege to represent the United States in Singapore and Papua New Guinea, at ASEAN and APEC. There, we will unveil new measures and programs to support a free and open Indo-Pacific. And on behalf of the President, I will deliver the message that America’s commitment to the Indo-Pacific has never been stronger. (Applause.)

我也很乐意地告诉大家，我们正在精简国际的发展关系以及金融规划。我们正给予其它国家一个公开透明的选择，以取代中国的债务陷阱外交。事实上，在本周，特朗普总统将签署《建设法案》，将之变成法律。

Closer to home, to protect our interests, we’ve recently strengthened CFIUS — the Committee on Foreign Investment — heightening our scrutiny of Chinese investment in America to protect our national security from Beijing’s predatory actions. And when it comes to Beijing’s malign influence and interference in American politics and policy, we will continue to expose it, no matter the form it takes. We will work with leaders at every level of society to defend our national interests and most cherished ideals. The American people will play the decisive role — and, in fact, they already are.

下个月，我很荣幸，将代表美国出席在新加坡和巴布亚新几内亚举行的东盟以及APEC峰会，在那里，我们将推出新的措施和计划，以支持自由开放的亚太地区贸易。谨代表总统，我将会发布一份声明，美国对亚太地区的承诺从未如此坚定过。说到痛处，为了保护我们的利益，我们最近已经加强了CFIUS——一个外国投资委员会——正提高中国在美国投资的审查，为了保护从北京掠夺性的行为中保护我们的国家安全。当涉及到北京的不良影响以及干涉美国的政治和政策，我们将继续曝光，不管以什么样的形式。我们将与社会各阶层的领导一起，去捍卫我们的国家利益和我们最珍惜的理念。美国人民将扮演决定性的角色——事实上，他们已经这么做了。

As we gather here, a new consensus is rising across America. More business leaders are thinking beyond the next quarter, and thinking twice before diving into the Chinese market if it means turning over their intellectual property or abetting Beijing’s oppression. But more must follow suit. For example, Google should immediately end development of the “Dragonfly” app that will strengthen Communist Party censorship and compromise the privacy of Chinese customers. (Applause.)

当我们聚集一堂，美国正达成一个新的共识。更多的商界领袖正在考虑下一个季度之后，他们会重新考虑在进入中国市场后，是否意味着他们要交出知识产权或者与教唆北京的镇压活动。但更多的人会跟着这么做。比如，谷歌应该马上停止“飞龙”应用的开发，那将会加强了共产党的审查制度以及危害中国客户的隐私。

It’s also great to see more journalists reporting the truth without fear or favor, digging deep to find where China is interfering in our society, and why. And we hope that American and global news organizations will continue to join this effort on an increasing basis. More scholars are also speaking out forcefully and defending academic freedom, and more universities and think tanks are mustering the courage to turn away Beijing’s easy money, recognizing that every dollar comes with a corresponding demand. And we’re confident that their ranks will grow.

很高兴看到有更多的记者抛开恐惧或喜好去报道真相，深挖中国在哪里以及为什么破坏我们的社会。我们希望美国和全球的新闻机构将继续不断地在此基础上努力。更多的学者也积极发言以及捍卫言论自由，更多的大学和智库也正鼓足勇气拒绝北京不义资金，认识到每一块钱都附带着相应的要求。我们相信这样的队伍会越来越壮大。

And across the nation, the American people are growing in vigilance, with a newfound appreciation for our administration’s actions and the President’s leadership to reset America’s economic and strategic relationship with China. Americans stand strong behind a President that’s putting America first.

环顾全国，美国人民的警觉性越来越高，对我们政府的行为以及用总统的领导力去重塑美国的经济以及与中国的策略关系报之以赞赏。美国人民坚定地与把美国第一放在首位的总统站在一起。

And under President Trump’s leadership, I can assure you, America will stay the course. China should know that the American people and their elected officials in both parties are resolved.

在特朗普的领导力之下，我可以向你保证，美国将把这种行动坚持到底。中国应该知道美国人民和他们选举的两党官员的问题已经得到了解决。

As our National Security Strategy states: We should remember that “Competition does not always mean hostility,” nor does it have to. The President has made clear, we want a constructive relationship with Beijing where our prosperity and security grow together, not apart. While Beijing has been moving further away from this vision, China’s rulers can still change course and return to the spirit of reform and opening that characterize the beginning of this relationship decades ago. The American people want nothing more; and the Chinese people deserve nothing less.

正如我们的国家安全策略声明的那样：我们应该牢记“竞争并不一直意味着敌对，”也不是必须的。总统已经明确地表示，我们希望与北京的关系是建设性的，在这样的关系中，我们的繁荣和安全会共同发展，不是各顾各的。尽管北京过去一直在远离这个愿景，中国的统治者依然能改变路线、回到二十多年前中美关系开始时的描述的那种改革开放的理念中去。美国人民别无所求，中国人民理应得到更多。

The great Chinese storyteller Lu Xun often lamented that his country, and he wrote, “has either looked down at foreigners as brutes, or up to them as saints,” but never “as equals.” Today, America is reaching out our hand to China. And we hope that soon, Beijing will reach back with deeds, not words, and with renewed respect for America. But be assured: we will not relent until our relationship with China is grounded in fairness, reciprocity, and respect for our sovereignty. (Applause.)

中国伟大的作家鲁迅常为他的国家所哀伤，他写道，是“或视外邦人为畜类，或视他们为圣徒，”但永远“没有平等地看待过他们。”今天，美国向中国伸出了双手。我们希望在不久之后，北京将以行为回应，而不是语言，以全新的尊重的态度对待美国。但请放心：我们不会再发怜悯之心，直到中国与我们的关系建立在公平、互惠以及对我们主权的尊重之上。

There is an ancient Chinese proverb that reads, “Men see only the present, but heaven sees the future.” As we go forward, let us pursue a future of peace and prosperity with resolve and faith. Faith in President Trump’s leadership and vision, and the relationship that he has forged with China’s president. Faith in the enduring friendship between the American people and the Chinese people. And Faith that heaven sees the future — and by God’s grace, America and China will meet that future together. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

有一句古老的中国谚语，“人见目前, 天见久远。”当我们迈步向前的时候，让我们用决心和信仰去追逐和平和繁荣的未来。对特朗普总统和领导力和愿景充满了信心，以及对与中国主席建立的关系也充满了信心。对美国人民与中国人民的永恒友谊充满了信心。相信天堂能看到未来——通过神的恩典，美国和中国将会一起迎接未来。谢谢，上帝保佑你。天佑美国。
